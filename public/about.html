        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Midrash aggadah was given much prominence and importance in the period of the Tannaim and Amoraim as an indispensable supplement to halachah and other areas of Torah study. חז״ל understood that aside from expounding the laws in all their minutiae which govern the mitzvot and how a Jew is meant to behave, there is also a need for teachings that embody the rest of day-to-day life.</p>
        
        <p>Aggadot were woven into the Talmudim as an integral, inseparable part of Torah SheBeAl Peh (the Oral Law), and many Sefarim were written with additional aggadot even into the period of the Rishonim. Yet in recent centuries, knowledge - and arguably, appreciation - for the aggadic part of our mesorah has declined.</p>
        
        <p>There are not nearly as many commentaries or works written which deal in a deep, comprehensive way with aggadot the way that a myriad of Sefarim have been written about halachic topics. And yet, midrash aggadah has much to offer Torah-observant Jews who seek a rich, vibrant Judaism, something that is needed especially in today's world.</p>
        
        <p><strong>This website therefore aims to provide accessible shiurim and Sefarim on various concepts and ideas that are explored in חז״ל with the goal of helping to address this need.</strong> In the spirit of the Torah being something which should be accessible to everyone, all sources on this website are free to use and share (and should be shared in order to increase הרבצת התורה).</p>

        <h2>What is Midrash Aggadah?</h2>
        <p>Midrash Aggadah refers to the non-legal exegetical texts in rabbinic literature. While Midrash Halakha focuses on Jewish law, Midrash Aggadah explores ethical principles, theological concepts, and narrative expansions of biblical stories. These texts often fill in gaps in biblical narratives, explore character motivations, and draw moral lessons from the text.</p>
        
        <p>Aggadic midrashim can be found throughout rabbinic literature, including the Talmud, dedicated midrashic collections like Midrash Rabbah, and medieval compilations. These texts have profoundly influenced Jewish thought, art, literature, and spirituality throughout the centuries.</p>
        
        <p>This website has shiurim on Ein Yaakov, a work by Rabbi Yaakov Ibn Habib that compiled all the aggadic (i.e. non-halachic) sections of the Talmud, on the weekly parsha, and on other midrashic works (i.e. Tanna Devei Eliyahu). It also contains original, standalone Sefarim written in English and Rabbinic Hebrew.</p>

        <h2>Educational Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Our approach to Jewish learning emphasizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Making complex aggadic concepts understandable to modern learners</li>
          <li><strong>Authenticity</strong> - Staying true to classical sources while providing contemporary insights</li>
          <li><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong> - Covering topics in depth with proper source material</li>
          <li><strong>Free Access</strong> - All materials available without cost to promote Torah study</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We believe that midrash aggadah has tremendous relevance for modern Jewish life and spiritual growth, offering wisdom that complements halachic study and enriches one's relationship with Torah and Jewish tradition.</p>

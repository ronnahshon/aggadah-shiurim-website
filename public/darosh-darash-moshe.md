*מנחם אב תשפ״ג / August 2023*

This introduction speaks to the methodology employed in this work, a methodology I refer to as *meta-midrash*. It is an aggadic midrash of aggadic midrashim, analyzing them using the exegetical tools they use to analyze holy texts. For example, aggadic midrash weaves together different pesukim from different books in Tanach to make a cohesive whole, and the goal of this work is to engage in the same exercise, but at the midrashic level: weaving together different midrashic traditions into a cohesive whole.

The introduction also elucidates a theory of midrashic pedagogy I refer to as חוט המשולש in the spirit of ״והחוט המשולש לא במהרה ינתק״ (קהלת ד, יב), "the three-corded string does not easily come apart." It argues that there are three essential layers which are combined to develop, in composite, classical aggadic midrashim:

**Linguistic.** Begin with some anomaly or difficulty in the language, structure or grammar of one or more pesukim. This can be based on strange spelling, improper tense, etc.

**Thematic.** Use those linguistic difficulties coupled with relevant contextual questions as a springboard to develop broader ideas in line with Rabbinic principles or beliefs.

**Ethical.** Uses those developed ideas to teach lessons about how to live a more spiritually oriented life; alternatively, how to relate to Judaism and the Creator in an intimate way.

This Sefer focuses on expounding three different ascent of Moshe Rabbeinu and his brother Aharon up a hill or a mountain. Each chapter explores a respective ascent in midrashic depth and develops innovative and original approaches based on midrashim from the aggadic works of Hazal and the Sages of later generations.

Instead of systematically describing the three-tiered חוט המשולש structure I have chosen instead to discuss how different midrashim contradict and complement each other in a more poetic, analytical way, in the style of the midrashic literature itself which is infamously non-structured. Along the way I do attempt to highlight when the Rabbis are engaging in each level of exegesis and propose what is likely motivating them, all while building a grander, "meta-midrashic" narrative for each respective ascent.

**Structure of Work**

Every one of the **Three Chapters** opens with a **General Introduction** followed by  **Three Parts**, each of which contains its own **Introduction** and **Four Sections**. In addition, every chapter has **Over 100 Footnotes** of varying lengths. These footnotes aim to provide sources for quoted teachings, include any relevant additional sources, and add additional layers of detailed analysis.

NOTE: As this work is still a work in progress, please be mindful of the following caveats:

- Inconsistency in translations
- Inconsistency in transliterations
- Various footnotes that need updating

**Midrash Ha'Aliyah**

I took the midrashic insights developed in this work and, while trying to stay reasonably true to the text of the work and the order its ideas are developed in, created a new midrash called Midrash Ha'Aliyah. This Midrash is written in Hebrew and in the style of the classical aggadic midrashim of Hazal. In particular, this Midrash is meant to be similar to works such as Midrash Rabbah, and pays homage to the authors of these ancient masterpieces. It includes existing midrashim referenced in the work while crafting new ones that stand alongside them, with the aim of enriching them while maintaining the stylistic integrity of the originals.

The structure of Midrash Ha'Aliyah mirrors the structure of this work. It also has **Three Perakim** (chapters), each of which focuses on a different respective ascent of Moshe Rabbeinu and Aharon. Each Perek contains **16 Mishnayot** and **250-300** footnotes. Unlike in this work, the footnotes of Midrash Ha'Aliyah do not contain any additional commentary; they simply provide the sources being quoted. A bibliography is also available which categorizes the sources referenced by the Midrash.

May it be His will that this work help contribute to the spread and knowledge of the holy Torah's wisdom and beauty. Amen.

"Amalek came and fought against Yisrael in Rephidim. Moshe said to Yehoshua: Choose for us men, and go out to fight against Amalek; tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill, with the staff of G-d in my hand. Yehoshua did as Moshe told him, to fight against Amalek, while Moshe, Aharon and Hur ascended to the top of the hill. Whenever Moshe raised his hand, Yisrael would gain the upper hand, but whenever Moshe lowered his hand, Amalek would gain the upper hand. Moshe's hands got heavy, so they took a rock and placed it under him and he sat on it. Aharon and Hur supported Moshe's hands, one on one side and one on the other side; and so his hands were steady until sunset. Yehoshua weakened Amalek and his nation by the sword." (Shmot 17: 8-13)
</div>
</div>

A fledgling nation, recently granted its freedom from centuries of oppression, treks through an unfriendly wilderness and into the unknown. Bnai Yisrael struggle with their newfound freedom, divided into various tribes and a large assortment of tagalongs, the I*erev rav*. Moshe is undisputed and in charge, but who he commands is more akin to an amalgam of slaves than a proud and free people. Millions wandering in the desert demand clearly defined roles and responsibilities for various levels of leadership; governmental structures need to be put into place, a system of laws and courts must be established. Yet even a month after Bnai Yisrael's independence was realized, other than Moshe himself no formal positions have been designated.

It is with memories of slavery still fresh and present in their minds that Bnai Yisrael are suddenly attacked for the first time. War is the ultimate uniting force in times of uncertainty, and existential threat by a ruthless enemy is a strong motivator to set aside any internal strife and join together as one people. Yet no nation can survive such trying times without strong leadership and a robust army; a show of solidarity from Moshe and other heads of the people is necessary in order to defeat Amalek. But what areas of leadership do the unique circumstances of this new nation demand, and what type of political structure is required to meet them?

In the haste to escape Egyptian bondage these questions have gone unaddressed; Amalek has forced Moshe's hand much earlier than expected. Amalek was eager to fight against the Jews, chomping at the bit like a rabid dog.**^[1]{.underline}^** The pesukim indicate that the ambush was sudden and unprovoked,**^[2]{.underline}^** catching Moshe and the nation off guard. A general must immediately be appointed to lead Bnai Yisrael into battle, and Moshe designates Yehoshua, described by the Torah as a *na'ar*,**^[3]{.underline}^** to command the nation's untrained forces.**^[4]{.underline}^** Moshe knows that Yehoshua alone will not be enough to unify the people, for Amalek is a powerful enemy and Bnai Yisrael are unaccustomed to fighting in war.**^[5]{.underline}^** Moshe realizes that he too must be a symbol of strength for the people, and elects to pray on their behalf in clear view of the day-old soldiers; any necessary spiritual and military preparations are implemented quickly and within 24 hours of the attack,**^[6]{.underline}^** establishing a thematically meaningful precedent for confrontation with Amalek in the future.**^[7]{.underline}^**

As Moshe's hands grow heavy, two other important figures step in to support him: Aharon and Hur. Aharon is certainly a familiar face to us, and a natural contender to help Moshe inspire the troops fighting below. He was, after all, introduced earlier in Sefer Shmot, and played a central role in *yetziat mitzrayim*. And while this is the first we hear of Yehoshua in the Torah, his worthiness for the role assigned to him here is bolstered by the righteousness, loyalty and bravery he displays later on in the Torah. In contrast, Hur is a complete enigma, a mysterious figure who appears and disappears without any explanation,**^[8]{.underline}^** and the clarity of his role within the nobility of Bnai Yisrael is diametrically opposed to that of the others.

The imagery provoked by this story is incredibly powerful, almost picturesque: Moshe sitting atop a hill perched on a rock, hands held high by Aharon on one side and Hur on the other, while Yehoshua leads an inexperienced army to victory over their more seasoned attackers in the valley below. The visual of Moshe, Aharon and Hur united in grim determination and connected with their hands stretched heavenward, grasping the miraculous staff of G-d, is - as the pesukim tell us - a symbol of *"faith until the sun set"* **^[9]{.underline}^** that surely boosted the peoples' morale. Why should this be so?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וְהָיָה כַּאֲשֶׁר יָרִים משֶׁה יָדוֹ וְגָבַר יִשְׂרָאֵל וְגוֹ(שמות יז, יא), וְכִי יָדָיו שֶׁל משֶׁה עוֹשׂוֹת מִלְחָמָה אוֹ שׁוֹבְרוֹת מִלְחָמָה. אֶלָּא לוֹמַר לְךָ, כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהָיוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִסְתַּכְּלִים כְּלַפֵּי מַעְלָה וּמְשַׁעְבְּדִין אֶת לִבָּם לַאֲבִיהֶם שֶׁבַּשָּׁמַיִם הָיוּ מִתְגַּבְּרִים. וְאִם לָאו, הָיוּ נוֹפְלִין:**^[10]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'When Moshe raised his hands, Yisrael had the upper hand' (Shmot 17:11). Did Moshe's hands determine victory or defeat? Rather, this teaches you that whenever Yisrael looked up and gave over their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they would have the upper hand, and if not, they would fall."**^[10]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Another layer has been added to this symbolism: Hashem watching over the people in Heaven, dwelling above Moshe, Aharon and Hur who are pointing up with their hands towards Him, and who are standing above Yehoshua and the people, who are in turn directing their eyes up towards Him as they fight Amalek. This interconnectedness between the army, the leadership, and HaKadosh Baruch Hu Himself generated a profound sense of unity that allowed Yisrael to win and best the mighty antagonist; this achievement was so noteworthy that Hashem commanded it be written in a book and *"placed in Yehoshua's ear"*, perhaps as a testament to how one should successfully rally Bnai Yisrael in the future.

Moshe, Aharon and Yehoshua are all key players in the drama of Bnai Yisrael's journey to Eretz Canaan, so Hur is in esteemed company. But who was he? Surely the Torah does not hide essential information from us unless there is good reason. Can Hur's prominence in the battle against Bnai Yisrael's first enemy teach us something about why Bnai Yisrael were able to win, against at best improbable odds? Can it shed light on why Amalek, more than any other nation, is enshrined as the archnemesis of Yisrael, and whose very existence must paradoxically be consciously erased from the peoples' collective memory? And is the mystery of Hur's sudden appearance and disappearance perhaps the key to unlocking a greater understanding of what determines Bnai Yisrael's successes and failures, not just in the desert, but for all time?**^[11]{.underline}^**



**Part 1: Destined to Rule**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

What makes Hur such a textbook subject for aggadic exegesis is not simply that he is first portrayed by the Torah as a valued member of the nation's elite while at the same time being introduced without any background, history, or origin story; it is that the name Hur appears in several other places in Tanach, and most of those references are similarly ambiguous and obscure. On a *peshat* level, at least some of these other references to a Hur must be talking about a different Hur than Moshe's trustworthy supporter from the battle with Amalek. The midrash, however, sees in the character of Hur a perfect opportunity: it notes multiple anomalies in the text's language and grammar, resolves them through a poetic conservation and unification of different Biblical personalities, and reveals both important hashkafic cornerstones of Chazal as well as valuable lessons on proper conduct and belief.

The second time the name Hur is mentioned it apparently refers to the same person:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיָּ֣קׇם מֹשֶׁ֔ה וִיהוֹשֻׁ֖עַ מְשָׁרְת֑וֹ וַיַּ֥עַל מֹשֶׁ֖ה אֶל הַ֥ר הָאֱלֹהִֽים׃ וְאֶל הַזְּקֵנִ֤ים אָמַר֙ שְׁבוּ לָ֣נוּ בָזֶ֔ה עַ֥ד אֲשֶׁר נָשׁ֖וּב אֲלֵיכֶ֑ם וְהִנֵּ֨ה אַהֲרֹ֤ן וְחוּר֙ עִמָּכֶ֔ם מִי בַ֥עַל דְּבָרִ֖ים יִגַּ֥שׁ אֲלֵהֶֽם׃**^[12]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Moshe and Yehoshua, his attendant, rose up, and Moshe ascended the mountain of G-d. He said to the elders, wait here for us until we return. Aharon and Hur are here with you; anyone who has some legal matter can come before them."**^[12]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Here too we find Hur as a counterpart to Aharon; here too the context is as a support for Moshe; and here too we also find Yehoshua making an appearance, albeit again with a distinct function from Aharon and Hur. Shmot 17 presents Hur and Aharon as Moshe's right-hand men in a literal sense, while Shmot 24 deems them as Moshe's representatives in his absence. They are Moshe's main artery of support, chosen to adjudicate any crises in his stead while he is away, and again we get the impression that Hur is already well established in his role as a leader. Moshe assumes that everyone knows who Hur is, yet we the readers are left in the dark.

If one stopped reading at this point and erased any prior knowledge of how the Torah narrative unfolds, and instead tried to predict its continuation solely based on what the text reveals up to and including Shmot 24, one would expect Hur to continue as Aharon's peer going forward. One would not be surprised if both of them played a vital role in the remainder of Bnai Yisrael's sojourns in the desert and eventual arrival in Eretz Canaan. Although Aharon is Moshe's brother and has a pivotal role to play during *yetziat mitzrayim*, once Bnai Yisrael become a nation free of Egypt's subjugation in Shmot 14, Aharon and Hur are portrayed as complete equals both before and including *Matan Torah*.

However, the fates of Aharon and Hur do not remain intertwined, and cease to continue in parallel. Aharon becomes Kohen Gadol and has a prominent leadership role in both a religious and political capacity later on. But what of Hur? Shmot 17 and Shmot 24 are the only two mentions of Hur in this capacity, namely as a top-level official and supporter of Moshe's; after Moshe's ascent to Har Sinai he completely disappears. The question becomes sharper: who was Hur? Why for a brief period was he on the same level as Aharon and second only to Moshe Rabbeinu, and why does he conspicuously disappear? Perhaps we can - and should - use other mentions of Hur, even ones that on the surface refer to someone else entirely, to help bridge our gap in understanding and create a more holistic picture of who Hur actually was.

**[Righteous Martyr]{.underline}**

Moshe spends forty days and nights atop Har Sinai while Aharon and Hur are left to manage the nation in his stead. The allotted period elapses and Moshe fails to return; the restless people turn to Aharon with their infamous demands:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיַּ֣רְא הָעָ֔ם כִּֽי בֹשֵׁ֥שׁ מֹשֶׁ֖ה לָרֶ֣דֶת מִן הָהָ֑ר וַיִּקָּהֵ֨ל הָעָ֜ם עַֽל אַהֲרֹ֗ן וַיֹּאמְר֤וּ אֵלָיו֙ ק֣וּם עֲשֵׂה לָ֣נוּ אֱלֹהִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֤ר יֵֽלְכוּ֙ לְפָנֵ֔ינוּ כִּי זֶ֣ה מֹשֶׁ֣ה הָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱלָ֙נוּ֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם לֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְנוּ מֶה הָ֥יָה לֽוֹ׃ וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ אַהֲרֹ֔ן פָּֽרְקוּ֙ נִזְמֵ֣י הַזָּהָ֔ב אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י נְשֵׁיכֶ֔ם בְּנֵיכֶ֖ם וּבְנֹתֵיכֶ֑ם וְהָבִ֖יאוּ אֵלָֽי׃ וַיִּתְפָּֽרְקוּ֙ כׇּל הָעָ֔ם אֶת נִזְמֵ֥י הַזָּהָ֖ב אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּאׇזְנֵיהֶ֑ם וַיָּבִ֖יאוּ אֶֽל אַהֲרֹֽן׃ וַיִּקַּ֣ח מִיָּדָ֗ם וַיָּ֤צַר אֹתוֹ֙ בַּחֶ֔רֶט וַֽיַּעֲשֵׂ֖הוּ עֵ֣גֶל מַסֵּכָ֑ה וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶעֱל֖וּךָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃ וַיַּ֣רְא אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַיִּ֥בֶן מִזְבֵּ֖חַ לְפָנָ֑יו וַיִּקְרָ֤א אַֽהֲרֹן֙ וַיֹּאמַ֔ר חַ֥ג לַיהֹוָ֖ה מָחָֽר׃ וַיַּשְׁכִּ֙ימוּ֙ מִֽמׇּחֳרָ֔ת וַיַּעֲל֣וּ עֹלֹ֔ת וַיַּגִּ֖שׁוּ שְׁלָמִ֑ים וַיֵּ֤שֶׁב הָעָם֙ לֶֽאֱכֹ֣ל וְשָׁת֔וֹ וַיָּקֻ֖מוּ לְצַחֵֽק׃**^[13]{.underline}^**

<div style="flex: 1;">
"The nation saw that Moshe was delayed in coming down from the mountain, so the nation gathered around Aharon and said to him: Get up, make us a god that will go before us, for this man Moshe who took us out of Egypt - we do not know what happened to him. Aharon said to him: Remove your golden rings that are on the ears of your wives, sons and daughters, and bring them to me. The whole nation removed the golden rings in their ears and brought them to Aharon. He took the rings from their hands, and cast it into a mold, and made from it a molten calf. The nation said: This is your god, Yisrael, who took you out of Egypt. Aharon saw, and built an altar before it, and Aharon called out and said: A holiday for Hashem tomorrow. The nation rose the next morning, and they brought burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; the nation sat to eat and drink, and got up to play."**^[13]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The people see that for some reason - Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi blames Satan for the confusion**^[14]{.underline}^** - Moshe is delayed and has not returned at the expected time. But Moshe had set up a contingency plan, and explicitly put both Hur and Aharon in charge before he ascended the mountain. To explore why Hur is absent while this terrible debacle unfolds and from all subsequent narratives in the Torah, the midrash notes that this is the first story told since Hur was last mentioned as alive and well;**^[15]{.underline}^** it is also sensitive to the fact that Aharon alone is consulted, while Hur, who was similarly appointed by Moshe, is not. Midrash aggadah abhors a vacuum, and this story of the golden calf is a turning point in the narrative as far as Hur is concerned - something must be missing here, we are not being told the whole story.

Given Hur's authoritative presence at the onset of 40 days, and the total lack of backstory as to why he was chosen for that position, the midrash explains where he disappeared to, while simultaneously retroactively justifying his original position:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רַבִּי בֶּרֶכְיָה בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי אַבָּא בַּר כַּהֲנָא פָּתַר קְרָיָא בְּאַהֲרֹן, בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁעָשׂוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל אוֹתוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה, בַּתְּחִלָּה הָלְכוּ אֵצֶל חוּר, אָמְרוּ לוֹ (שמות לב, א): קוּם עֲשֵׂה לָנוּ אֱלֹהִים, כֵּיוָן שֶׁלֹּא שָׁמַע לָהֶן עָמְדוּ עָלָיו וַהֲרָגוּהוּ, הֲדָא הוּא דִכְתִיב (ירמיה ב, לד): גַּם בִּכְנָפַיִךְ נִמְצְאוּ דַּם וגו', וְזֶהוּ דָּמוֹ שֶׁל חוּר, (ירמיה ב, לד): לֹא בַמַּחְתֶּרֶת מְצָאתִים כִּי עַל כָּל אֵלֶּה, עַל אֲשֶׁר עָשׂוּ (שמות לב, ד): אֵלֶּה אֱלֹהֶיךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל. וְאַחַר כָּךְ הָלְכוּ אֵצֶל אַהֲרֹן, אָמְרוּ לוֹ: קוּם עֲשֵׂה לָנוּ אֱלֹהִים, כֵּיוָן שֶׁשָּׁמַע אַהֲרֹן כֵּן מִיָּד נִתְיָרֵא, הֲדָא הוּא דִּכְתִיב (שמות לב, ה): וַיַּרְא אַהֲרֹן וַיִּבֶן מִזְבֵּחַ לְפָנָיו, נִתְיָרֵא מֵהַזָּבוּחַ לְפָנָיו, אָמַר אַהֲרֹן מָה אֶעֱשֶׂה הֲרֵי הָרְגוּ אֶת חוּר שֶׁהָיָה נָבִיא, עַכְשָׁיו אִם הוֹרְגִים אוֹתִי שֶׁאֲנִי כֹּהֵן מִתְקַיֵּם עֲלֵיהֶם הַמִּקְרָא שֶׁכָּתוּב (איכה ב, כ): אִם יֵהָרֵג בְּמִקְדַּשׁ ה' כֹּהֵן וְנָבִיא, וּמִיָּד הֵם גּוֹלִין:**^[16]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Berachiyah said in the name of Rabbi Abba Bar Kahana, expounding on the pasuk about Aharon. When Yisrael was about to commit that act i.e. make the golden calf they first came to Hur, and they said to him: 'Get up, make us a god' (Shmot 32:1). Since he did not listen to them, they rose up and killed him. This is why it says: 'Also in your wings we find the blood of the souls of the innocent and the poor' (Yirmiyahu 2:34) - this refers to the blood of Hur, because they did: 'This is your god, Yisrael' (Shmot 32:4). Afterwards, they went to Aharon and said to him: 'Get up, make us a god'. When Aharon heard about what they did to Hur, he became afraid, as it says: 'Aharon saw, and built an altar before it' (Shmot 32:5) - interpret it not as saw, but was afraid: Aharon was frightened by the one slaughtered before him i.e. Hur. Aharon said, what should I do? They have already killed Hur, and he was a prophet. Now if they kill me, and I am a Kohen, they will fulfill what it says: 'Should a Kohen and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of Hashem (Eicha 2:20)', and immediately will be exiled."**^[16]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Hur was not only present when the golden calf was conceived of; he was approached by the people before Aharon. Perhaps the nation felt that Hur would be more amenable to acquiescing to their request than Aharon, though in order to understand why we need to further understand who exactly Hur was. Yet regardless of the people's motivation to approach him first, Hur refused to listen to them, and in a rage the violent mob took his life. This missing section of narrative conveniently ties another loose knot in the story of the golden calf, namely a justification for Aharon's actions: how could the future Kohen Gadol so willingly agree to such outrageous and blasphemous demands? It would take seeing Hur's slain body before him - and nothing less - to convince a terrified Aharon he needed to meet the people's demands.

A later midrashic tradition**^[17]{.underline}^** provides some more color to Hur's response:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי הַשָֹּׂטָן מָצָא אֶת יָדָיו אוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה, שֶׁהָיָה משֶׁה נִרְאֶה תָּלוּי בֵּין הַשָּׁמַיִם וְהָאָרֶץ וְהָיוּ מַרְאִין אוֹתוֹ בָּאֶצְבַּע וְאוֹמֵר: כִּי זֶה משֶׁה הָאִישׁ. אוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה עָמַד עֲלֵיהֶם חוּר וְאָמַר לָהֶם קְצִיעֵי צַוָּארַיָא, אֵין אַתֶּם נִזְכָּרִים מַה נִּסִּים עָשָׂה לָכֶם הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, מִיָּד עָמְדוּ עָלָיו וַהֲרָגוּהוּ. נִכַּנְסוּ עַל אַהֲרֹן, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיִּקָּהֵל הָעָם עַל אַהֲרֹן (שמות לב, א), וְאָמְרוּ לוֹ כְּשֵׁם שֶׁעָשִׂינוּ לָזֶה כָּךְ אָנוּ עוֹשִׂים לְךָ, כֵּיוָן שֶׁרָאָה אַהֲרֹן כָּךְ נִתְיָרֵא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות לב, ה): וַיַּרְא אַהֲרֹן וַיִּבֶן מִזְבֵּחַ לְפָנָיו, מַהוּ מִזְבֵּחַ, מִן הַזָּבוּחַ שֶׁלְּפָנָיו:**^[18]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The Rabbis say, Satan found his hands at that time, for Moshe was shown suspended between the heavens and the earth, and he was showing Moshe with his finger and saying: 'For this man Moshe' (Shmot 32:1). At that time Hur stood up against them and said, stiff-necked ones, do you not remember the miracles that HaKadosh Baruch Hu did for you? Immediately they attacked him and killed him. They gathered against Aharon, as it says: 'The nation gathered against Aharon' (Shmot 32:1) and said to him, as we did to Hur, so we will do to you if you do not agree with our demands. When Aharon saw this, he was afraid, as it says: 'Aharon saw, and built an altar before it' (Shmot 32:5) interpret it not as saw, but was afraid. Which altar? The one which was slaughtered before him i.e. Hur."**^[18]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

While Vayikra Rabbah simply states that Hur *"did not listen to them"*, here we are told that *"Hur stood up against them"*. Hur rebukes the people, calling them stiff-necked and even asking rhetorically if they forgot the incredible, supernatural wonders G-d had performed on their behalf not even 100 days earlier. This paints Hur in a light which addresses one of our questions, at least partially. Why was Hur chosen as Aharon's peer, as ostensibly the third most powerful member of Bnai Yisrael? Because of his merit: he was a true leader who believed in HaKadosh Baruch Hu and held firm in his convictions, challenging the people to remain strong in their beliefs even when they were met with opposition.

This midrash is aiming to add some depth to the question of how to be an effective leader in times of crisis. What is the proper balance between leading based on one's personal beliefs and losing sight of what's best for the people? Put differently, what is the proper balance between being sensitive to - and addressing the needs of - the common man, without going to the extreme, becoming a sycophant and puppet without any personal morals to guide one's decision-making? Aharon and Hur, two leaders appointed by Moshe, are being set up as two different models of leadership, and their subsequent reactions highlight the choices such leaders can make.

Perhaps one message of this midrash, then, is to convey the importance of sticking to one's guns, even in the face of a rising populist tide and imminent personal danger. Or, perhaps the message is exactly the opposite, namely that a well-rounded leader should have a lucid yet subtle understanding of his people's needs in all situations, and know when it is necessary to compromise. A third possibility is that the midrash need not pass judgment on who was correct - Hur or Aharon - but merely aims to highlight the tension between these two options. There is, regardless, a clear message that comes from this comparison: a leader of Bnai Yisrael needs to think carefully and be very deliberate in the choices he makes, lest he be met with disaster.**^[19]{.underline}^**

While Vayikra Rabbah and Shmot Rabbah tell the same story, there are two key differences in how they each portray the archetypal defender of faith. In Vayikra Rabbah Hur does not say anything to the people; he is simply described as having not listened to them, a passive approach which nonetheless led to his death. Hur comes off as somewhat restrained, does not make any inflammatory remarks or counter Bnai Yisrael in their moment of passion. Shmot Rabbah, in contrast, describes Hur as a zealot and an iconoclast, someone whose fiery and unsolicited words provoked the people into action. Hur stood over the people and rebuked them harshly, an active protestor instead of an unsympathetic ear.**^[20]{.underline}^**

Still, we are left troubled. Even faced with the prospect of his own death, should Aharon have caved to pressure, or stood strong and refused to condone idolatry? *Avodah Zarah* was later deemed by Rabbinic decree as one of three cardinal sins that a person should die for rather than violate;**^[21]{.underline}^** how much more so when one's actions would cause many other Jewish people to sin as well?

"Why did HaKadosh Baruch Hu elevate Aharon and his sons to the station of Kehunah? Rabbi Mani of She'av and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sichnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, when Yisrael sought to commit that act i.e. make the golden calf they said to Aharon: 'Get up, make us a god' (Shmot 32:1) ... Know that the nation killed Hur, for Moshe told them before he ascended the mountain: 'Aharon and Hur are here with you; anyone who has some legal matter can come before them' (Shmot 24:14), but after Moshe descended, you find that Hur is not referred to as either living or dead. What does it say: 'And Moshe said to Aharon, what did this people do to you, that you have brought a great sin upon them' (ibid. 32:21) - therefore, conclude that they must have killed Hur.

'Aharon saw, and built an altar before it' (Shmot 32:5). Immediately he took a good ornament and threw it into the fire, as it says: 'I threw it into the fire and this calf came out' (Shmot 32:24). Aharon was afraid that HaKadosh Baruch Hu's heart held something against him for making the golden calf. Therefore HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'This is the thing that you should do for them, to sanctify them as priests before Me', in order to raise up and make great Aharon and his sons for the Kehunah Gedolah, since it was known before Him that Aharon had acted only out of fear, and therefore He let them know that HaKadosh Baruch Hu's heart holds nothing against him."**^[22]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This midrash succinctly and explicitly summarizes some of the questions raised earlier regarding Hur's sudden appearance and disappearance, but its primary motivation is vindication of Aharon as evidenced by its opening and closing framework. Not only does Aharon not get killed, but his sin - and Moshe's apparent anger - seem to go punished. Quite the opposite: Aharon is Kohen Gadol, a great honor and one which at first glance is difficult to understand given his actions. And yet, the conclusion is unmistakable: Hur, idealistic and loyal to G-d, lies slaughtered on the ground, while Aharon, realistic and unwilling to fall on his sword, is promoted to the high priesthood.**^[23]{.underline}^**

Aharon's decision to cave and listen to the people, while less heroic in a certain respect, was the proper course of action according to this midrash. Hur died for his trouble, while Aharon escaped with both the people's love and Hashem's approval. Is this really what we are meant to take away from this episode, that bowing to pressure from an unruly group is the wiser course of action while opposing them goes unnoticed and unappreciated by history? The midrash has also painted itself into a corner, since as it stands this conclusion has troubling *hashkafic* implications: while the forgiveness shown towards Aharon is understandable and expected from a G-d of mercy and love, HaKadosh Baruch Hu is surely also a G-d of justice who rewards His righteous servants and avenges the spilling of innocent blood. Hur's death rings empty, and he seems to have died in vain - where do we find his due reward, the recognition for his fidelity and courage?

**[Adam's Book]{.underline}**

The next time a person named Hur appears in the Torah is as a paternal ancestor of Betzalel:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Hashem spoke to Moshe, see that I have called by name Betzalel son of Uri son of Hur from the tribe of Yehudah. I have endowed him with a spirit of G-d, with wisdom, insight and knowledge in every type of craft. To make designs for work from gold, silver and copper, to cut stones for setting and to carve wood, to work in every type of craft."**^[24]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There are two main schools of thought in the midrashic tradition as to why Betzalel was singled out and chosen as the Mishkan's main artisan in such a prodigious manner. The first approach is struck by the flowery language used to single out Betzalel: HaKadosh Baruch Hu "calls him by name", a concept not often used by the Torah, and he is filled with the Divine spirit along with an abundance of "wisdom, insight and knowledge", the very traits used by G-d to create the world as well as the *Beit HaMikdash*.**^[25]{.underline}^** Emphasis is even placed on the need for G-d Himself to appoint Betzalel instead of some emissary or agent.**^[26]{.underline}^** Such unusually lofty designations and gifts hardly seem commensurate with any theoretical actions Betzalel could have taken to prove himself deserving of them. Instead they indicate a deeper truth, that Betzalel had been predestined for this role, indeed born in order to fulfill it. His soul had been created for this very task since the beginning of creation; this is why Betzalel knew how to harness the powers of creation themselves.**^[27]{.underline}^**

In particular, this midrashic tradition is puzzled by the phrase *"See, I have called by name Betzalel"* (Shmot 31:2). Although seeing can also mean taking to heart and internalizing, the word is still extraneous. It therefore must refer to literal seeing, and teach us that HaKadosh Baruch Hu actually has a way to demonstrate that Betzalel had been called by name. But how is this possible?**^[28]{.underline}^** There was a genealogical record of all mankind, written by G-d Himself in the days of Adam HaRishon and detailing all people destined to exist - from Adam himself until the end of days - and listed there among every other person with his respective task in this world was Betzalel as architect of the Mishkan.**^[29]{.underline}^**

The implications of this teaching are tremendous. Although it is Betzalel specifically that was called by name, it is not unique to him. On the contrary: every single person who ever lived or will live has been similarly called by name since the earliest days of creation, his mission in this world already known and ordained since the days of Adam HaRishon. If G-d is the omniscient Master of all creation, He must know - in the Divine sense, in a way that does not contradict that fundamental cornerstone of human uniqueness, free will**^[30]{.underline}^** - how all of history will unfold at the outset, as various pesukim brought by the midrash attest. In this sense, every single person was already designated from the womb - to borrow Yishayahu's poetic language - for the life he leads and the role he plays in the drama of human existence. The message is an affirmation of purpose and meaning: every person is called by name, one should view his life in this light. He has a place in this world, a destiny that is specific for him and that has been written in the Book from the beginning of time; the strange wording by Betzalel is meant to provide the proof-text for this broader *hashkafic* principle.

As much as this idea explains the textual difficulty, it simultaneously raises another problem: if Betzalel was not unique in this respect - as the midrash readily admits - why is he the one with whom the concept of being called by name is associated? Perhaps in response to this dilemma, a variant of the midrashic tradition found in Midrash Shocher Tov and Tanchuma Yelamdenu localizes the context of this principle to the specific narrative of Moshe receiving instruction on how to build the Mishkan. Moshe believed he was meant to construct it; why else would HaKadosh Baruch Hu give him such detailed instructions and without an indication of someone else to lead the effort? It is to dispel this idea that G-d informs Moshe that Betzalel is called by name.**^[31]{.underline}^** This resolves the quandary by explaining why Betzalel is the one specifically whose name calling is explicit in the text: it was required to alleviate any concern or confusion on Moshe's part regarding who was meant for this holy task.**^[32]{.underline}^** This explanation also draws a thematic parallel and support to other, distinct midrashim which explore similar themes regarding supernatural experiences that Moshe was privy to.**^[33]{.underline}^**

There is, however, an entirely different way to approach this description of Betzalel. Betzalel was called by name, chosen as the architect of the Mishkan, not because he was fated to do so from the beginning of time, but in order to make amends for a terrible wrong committed during the episode of the golden calf that had hitherto gone unavenged: the tragic death of Hur. But this assumes some connection between Hur's disappearance in Shmot 24 and the calling of Betzalel - grandson of Hur - in Shmot 31. Could the fact that both stories involve someone named Hur perhaps be the missing link between these stories?

**[Family Tree]{.underline}**

The terse description of Betzalel's paternal lineage provided in Sefer Shmot is greatly expanded upon in Divrei HaYamim:

"Kalev Ben Hetzron gave birth with his wife Azuvah, and with Yeriot. These were her sons: Yesher, Shovav and Ardon. Azuvah died, and Kalev took Efrat as a wife, and she gave birth to Hur. Hur gave birth to Uri, and Uri gave birth to Betzalel.

The sons of Yehudah: Peretz, Hetzron, Karmi, Hur and Shoval. Ra'aya son of Shoval gave birth to Yachat, Yachat gave birth to Achumai and Lahad - these are the Tzar'ati families. And these are the fathers of Eitam: Yizre'el, Yishma and Yidbash, and their sister's name was Hatzlelponi.Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah - these are the sons of Hur the first born of Efrat, the father of Beit Lechem."**^[34]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

We already noted that the name of Betzalel's grandfather is Hur, and now we are told that his father's name was Kalev, son of Hetzron. Hetzron was the son of Peretz, who was one of the sons of Yehudah, son of Yaakov Avinu. We are told that this Kalev had a wife named Azuvah, and when she died he remarried a woman named Efrat who was Hur's mother; Hur was Efrat's first born son.**^[35]{.underline}^** Betzalel was the great-grandson of Kalev and Efrat, and Kalev himself was the great-grandson of Yehudah and Tamar.**^[36]{.underline}^**

It appears that the Hur mentioned in Shmot 31 and Divrei HaYamim Aleph was a generation after Moshe and Aharon, which makes it very possible that they were contemporaries. Given that Moshe and Betzalel were contemporaries - and that they were three generations removed - surely it is not implausible to suggest that Betzalel's grandfather Hur, who was only one generation removed, also overlapped with Moshe and Aharon. This, however, is the limit of where the *peshat* can take us; beyond a reasonable assumption that they lived at the same time, there is no explicit indication that this Hur is related to the enigmatic Hur from the battle of Amalek.

Aggadah cannot tolerate names or characters which are lacking in background information, and it often attempts to lump multiple people together and claim they are actually one and the same.**^[37]{.underline}^** In particular, when one person is given many names - or more commonly, when there are many unidentified names that could be understood to belong to a single person - the midrash sees this as an opportunity to highlight something relevant about that person.**^[38]{.underline}^** Our case of two people named Hur, both mentioned in the same Sefer and without much backstory, yet both connected to prominent members of Bnai Yisrael and to Moshe in particular, is a paradigmatic example of when this strategy should be employed. The case to equate the two "Hurs" as one and the same is so compelling that it feels almost trivial, as if the midrash's hands are tied; it couldn't not make the association even if it wanted to, so strong is the evidence alluding to this identification, so beautifully are many open questions, textual anomalies, and - perhaps most crucially - thematic and ethical considerations elucidated as a result.

To fully appreciate the many loose threads tied together by making this single identification, we need to first dive into the midrashic complexity of Betzalel's family tree, and focus in particular on another name that appears multiple times: Kalev. Divrei HaYamim Aleph is unequivocal in assigning a man named Kalev as Hur's father. We are intimately familiar with someone named Kalev from later in the Torah, though like with Hur the simple *peshat* does not equate the two:

"Yehoshua Bin Nun and Kalev Ben Yefuneh from among those who scouted out the land tore their clothes. They said to the entire congregation of Bnai Yisrael: The land we passed through to scout out was very very good. If Hashem desires us He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey. Only do not rebel against Hashem; do not be afraid of the locals of the land, for they are our bread, their shadows have departed from them. Hashem is with us, do not be afraid. The entire congregation sought to stone them with rocks; and the glory of Hashem appeared by the Ohel Moed before all of Bnai Yisrael.

"The sons of Yehudah approached Yehoshua in Gilgal, and Kalev Ben Yefuneh HaKenizi said to him: You know the thing which Hashem spoke to Moshe the man of G-d about me and you at Kadesh Barnea. I was forty years old when Moshe the servant of Hashem sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I returned a report to him that was from my heart.

Yehoshua blessed Kalev, and gave him Kalev Ben Yefuneh Hevron as an inheritance. Hevron was an inheritance for Kalev Ben Yefuneh HaKenizi from then until this day, because he had remained loyal to Hashem the G-d of Yisrael. And the name of Hevron beforehand was Kiryat Arba; the man Arba was great among the giants. And the land rested from war."**^[40]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Who was Kalev Ben Yefuneh? It is true that he was both a representative of the tribe of Yehudah and a contemporary of Moshe and Aharon, both of which can also be said of Kalev Ben Hetzron.**^[41]{.underline}^** Yet from a *peshat* perspective it is much easier to justify equating the Hur from Shmot 24 with the Hur from Shmot 31, than it is to suggest equating Kalev Ben Yefuneh with Kalev Ben Hetzron on the other. This is because, as Ibn Ezra bitingly notes, there is indisputable evidence that they are different people, as anyone with intellect would understand.**^[42]{.underline}^** Presumably, the evidence he refers to is Kalev Ben Yefuneh's testament to being forty years old when the scouts were dispatched to spy out Eretz Canaan. That incident must have happened after Betzalel was called by name and after the Mishkan was built, since the sin of the spies occurred after Bnai Yisrael left Har Sinai and had begun traveling in the desert. If we claim that Kalev Ben Yefuneh is identical with Kalev Ben Hetzron, that would mean he was Betzalel's great-grandfather. But, we just saw he could not have been older than forty when Betzalel constructed the Mishkan. This puts an immense strain on the logical possibility of Betzalel being of age to lead such a project, for his great-grandfather was not even forty at the time.

Surprisingly, despite the above we find the Jerusalem Talmud making this very assertion:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"Rabbi Yehudah Ben Pazi said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi.
Rabbi Yosi BeRabbi Yehudah learned it from Achaz, as it was taught: Achaz gave birth at age nine; Haran gave birth at age six; and Kalev gave birth at age ten. This is in accordance with the one who taught: Kalev Ben Hetzron is identical with Kalev Ben Yefuneh"**^[43]{.underline}^**
</div>

Midrashic license allows one to bend and exaggerate the traditional boundaries in ways that *peshat* does not; nevertheless, midrash cannot simply ignore logical impossibility. How can it tolerate the "indisputable evidence" against such an interpretation?

"Rabbi Chiya son of Rabbah Bar Nachmani said in the name of Rav Chisda, and some will say Rav Chisda said in the name of Ze'iri, everyone agrees by a male who is nine years and a day that his intercourse is valid, and everyone agrees by a male who is under eight years that his intercourse is not valid. They only argued regarding an eight year old: Beit Shammai reasoned that we can learn from earlier generations, while Beit Hillel reasoned that we cannot learn from earlier generations.

How do we know that the earlier generations gave birth at eight years of age? ... From here: 'Betzalel Ben Uri Ben Hur from the tribe of Yehudah' (Shmot 38:22), and it says: 'Azuvah died, and Kalev took Efrat as a wife, and she birthed Hur' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:19). When Betzalel made the Mishkan, how old was he? At least thirteen, as it says: 'Every man from the work that they did' (Shmot 36:4), and it was taught: The first year, Moshe made the Mishkan; in the second year, he sent the spies, and it says: 'I Kalev was forty years only when Moshe the servant of Hashem sent me, etc.' (Yehoshua 14:7), and now behold I am eighty-five years old. So Kalev was forty, subtract fourteen because of Betzalel since he must have been at least thirteen the year before the spies were sent: This leaves twenty-six years. Subtract two years for three pregnancies one preceding the birth of Hur, son of Kalev, one preceding the birth of Uri, son of Hur, and one preceding the birth of Bezalel, son of Uri, and you find that each one gave birth at eight years."**^[44]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This discussion is fascinating and somewhat unique in that it blurs the line between midrashic fantasticism and legitimate halachic inquiry. For Beit Shammai, the aggadic tradition that Kalev Ben Hetzron is identical with Kalev Ben Yefunah / Kenaz is proof that the intercourse of an eight year old boy in earlier generations was physically - and halachically - viable. What was limited to a midrashic discussion has been expanded into an entirely different realm, one with halachic ramifications and very real implications for *hilchot kiddushin*. In addition to whatever other ethical lessons, theological truths or moral adages these aggadot will bear out in the end, we also conclude according to Beit Shammai that even though a male becomes a man at thirteen years old, the intercourse of an eight year old male is binding for marriage in halachah.

Kalev Ben Yefuneh is granted an additional honorific in Yehoshua 14 not found in the Torah: HaKenizi. This should remind us of the first judge Otniel whose father's name was also Kenaz; indeed, Kalev Ben Yefuneh HaKenizi and Otniel Ben Kenaz are explicitly described by Sefer Shoftim as brothers.**^[45]{.underline}^** So if Kalev was the son of Kenaz, why is he referred to as *"Ben Yefuneh"*? We already get a sense of where this is likely headed: this is just the opportunity the midrash needs to homiletically interpret the name of Kalev's father, because the pesukim have an inherent contradiction between Kenaz and Yefuneh, and we know it is in reference to the same person:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וכלב בן קנז הוא והלא כלב בן יפונה הוא מאי יפונה שפנה מעצת מרגלים ואכתי בן קנז הוא בן חצרון הוא דכתיב (דברי הימים א ב, יח) וכלב בן חצרון הוליד את עזובה אמר רבא חורגיה דקנז הוא:**^[46]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Was Kalev really the son of Kenaz - was he not the son of Yefuneh? Rather, he was actually the son of someone named Kenaz, in which case what does Yefuneh mean? That he turned from the advice of the spies. But still, was Kalev really the son of Kenaz - was he not the son of Hetzron, as it says: 'Kalev Ben Hetzron gave birth to Azuvah' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:18)? Rava said, Kalev was the stepson of Kenaz but is still referred to as HaKenizi."**^[46]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

While this passage explains the tension between Kenaz and Yefuneh - a tension that demands addressing, as the pesukim are explicit in referring to the same man using both monikers - it also equates him with Kalev Ben Hetzron, as the Jerusalem Talmud taught and in sharp conflict with the *peshat* according to Ibn Ezra. Where do these midrashim get this idea from, how do they justify it, and what is the primary motivating factor pushing them to make this assertion?

"'Since the midwives feared G-d, He made houses for them' (Shmot 1:21). Rav and Shmuel: one said they received the houses of Kehunah and Levayah, and the other said they received the houses of Malchut. The one who said Kehunah and Levayah, this is a reference to Aharon and Moshe, and the one who said Malchut - David was also descended from Miriam, as it says: 'Azuvah died, and Kalev took Efrat as a wife, and she gave birth to Hur' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:19), and it says: 'David was an Efratite' (Shmuel Aleph 17:12). 'Kalev Ben Hetzron gave birth with his wife Azuvah, and with Yeriot. These were her sons: Yesher, Shovav and Ardon' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:18). Was he the son of Hetzron - was he not the son of Yefuneh? Rather, he was actually the son of someone named Hetzron, in which case what does Yefuneh mean? That he turned from the advice of the spies. But still, was Kalev really the son of Hetzron - was he not the son of Kenaz, as it says: 'Otniel Ben Kenaz conquered it - he was Kalev's younger brother' (Shoftim 1:13)? Rava said, Kalev was the stepson of Kenaz but is still referred to as HaKenizi. You can see this is the case from the fact that the text calls Kalev HaKenizi and not Ben Kenaz, which indicates he was raised by him but not his son by blood."**^[47]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The Talmud in Masechet Sotah's springboard is a comment made in the first perek of Shmot in regards to the righteous midwives that defied Pharaoh's decree and delivered male Jewish babies. Cryptically, we are told that because of this *"He made houses for them"*, though it is not clear who made the houses - in particular, Hashem or Pharaoh - or what those houses actually were. The Talmud assumes that the object of this clause is Hashem, but the identity of these houses is subject to dispute. One opinion**^[48]{.underline}^** argues that the houses He awarded the midwives with were the houses of Malchut, and is a reference to the Davidic line. Yet how could these midwives be connected to David? The answer is an astonishing one: David came from Miriam. Yet Miriam was from the tribe of Levi, while David was from the tribe of Yehudah, so how could this be?

Kalev Ben Hetzron is described as having married a woman named Azuvah who died; he then married a woman named Efrat, who gave birth to Hur. David is referred to as coming from Efrat, which on a *peshat* level is a geographical reference but according to the midrash means he was descended from Kalev Ben Hetzron's wife Efrat. This Efrat was none other than Miriam, thus called because she caused Yisrael to increase and multiply.**^[49]{.underline}^** The midrash draws many other similar exegetical conclusions from the plethora of names found in Divrei HaYamim, but the main thrust of this midrash teaches that Miriam, sister of Aharon and Moshe, married Kalev Ben Hetzron, and as a result was the maternal ancestor of David HaMelech.**^[50]{.underline}^**

This astonishing midrashic leap redefines the relationship between Moshe and Betzalel as being meaningfully closer than we previously assumed. Instead of third cousins thrice removed as the *peshat* would have led us to believe, Betzalel's grandfather Hur has been transformed into Moshe and Aharon's nephew, making Betzalel their great-grandnephew; Pinchas was Betzalel's second cousin once removed.**^[51]{.underline}^** In other words, Hur is the son of Miriam and Kalev Ben Yefuneh, and therefore the nephew of Moshe and Aharon.**^[52]{.underline}^**

Among other incredible achievements accomplished by this midrash which we will explore shortly, this tradition provides information on Miriam's family, filling in where the text is silent. We know a fair amount about Moshe's immediate family, and of course have volumes of genealogical records for Aharon's priestly descendants, yet of Miriam's family we know nothing. By wedding her to Kalev and providing her with a child who has a major role to play in the pivotal stories of Har Sinai and *cheit haeigel*, the midrash is giving her a fuller and richer backstory in the process.

**[Seeds of Royalty]{.underline}**

Armed with this knowledge, we can finally understand what is motivating the midrash to equate Kalev Ben Hetzron with Kalev Ben Yefuneh, aside from a general desire to equate Biblical characters when feasible (see above **Note 37**): a solution to the mystery of who the Hur from the war of Amalek and the covenant at Har Sinai really was. If we still had any doubts as to how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together, the following midrash ties the disparate traditions together as one harmonious whole:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
הלכו להם אצל עושי דברו של משה, אהרן וחור בן אחותו. ומניין שהיה חור בן אחותו, שנ' ויקח לו כלב את אפרת ותלד לו את חור ולמה נקרא שמה של מרים אפרת אלא פלטני של בת מלכים גדולי הדור שכל נשיא וגדול שעמד בישראל נקרא שמו אפרתי שנאמר וירבעם בן נבט איש אפרתי וכן ודוד בן איש אפרתי וכי אפרתי היה והלא משבט יהודה היה אלא פלטי בן מלכים גדולי הדור.

ולפי שהיה חור משבט יהודה מגדולי הדור התחיל מוכיח את ישראל בדברים קשים כזבים שבישראל עמדו עליו והרגוהו. וראה אהרן לחור שנהרג ובנה מזבח להם, שנ' וירא אהרן ויבן מזבח לפניו מה ראה ראה שנהרג חור בן אהרן ובנה להם מזבח שנ' ויבן מזבח:**^[53]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Yisrael went to those who carried out the words of Moshe, i.e. Aharon and Hur, the son of his sister Miriam. How do we know that Hur was the son of Moshe's sister? Because it says: 'Kalev married Efrat, who gave birth to Hur" (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:19). Why was Miriam called Efrat? Because she was a daughter of the palace, a daughter of kings, one of the magnates of the generation; for every prince and great man who arose in Israel had himself called an Efratite, as it says: 'Yeravam Ben Nevat, an Efratite" (Melachim Aleph 11:26); and it says, 'David was the son of an Efratite" (Shmuel Aleph 17:12). Was he then an Efratite? Was he not from the tribe of Yehudah? Rather, David was a nobleman, a son of kings, one of the magnates of the generation.*

But since Hur was from the tribe of Yehudah, and one of the magnates of the generation, he began to reprove Israel with harsh words, and the plunderers of Yisrael rose against him and killed him. Aharon rose and saw that Hur, the son of his sister, had been slaughtered. He built for Yisrael an altar, as it says: 'Aharon saw, and built an altar before it' (Shmot 32:5)."**^[53]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

For the first time we see the Hur from Shmot 17 and Shmot 24 referred to as the son of Miriam, but it goes much further than that. He was one of the greatest men in his generation, from the tribe of royalty: Yehudah. Implicitly this midrash not only assumes that Kalev Ben Hetzron and Kalev Ben Yefuneh are identical; it also assumes that Hur Ben Hetzron is the same as the Hur appointed by Moshe - his uncle - alongside Aharon during the battle against Amalek and the miraculous events at Har Sinai.

Now we can understand why according to Vayikra Rabbah Yisrael went to Hur first, without even consulting Aharon. Hur was also of prestigious stock, and a great man in his own right; perhaps, being a generation younger than Aharon - who was already pushing 84 by this time - the impatient masses felt he would be easier to sway or more sympathetic to their cause.

A beautiful larger thematic connection is being drawn here as well. Hur is not only the son of Miriam, but also of Kalev Ben Yefuneh, and both of his parents' legacies are in defiantly standing up for what they believed was right. Miriam refused to succumb to Pharaoh's genocidal demands and acted in a way she felt was difficult and dangerous, but morally obligatory; remarkably, during the spies incident Kalev stood up to the popular, negative opinion of Bnai Yisrael with unshakeable conviction and an unwavering support in HaKadosh Baruch Hu. The Torah even tells us that Kalev would have been killed had Hashem not appeared and protected him and Yehoshua with a cloud of Glory (Bemidbar 14:10). Hur as portrayed in Shmot Rabbah does nearly exactly the same thing: namely, he stands up to a wicked mob intent on evil and defends HaKadosh Baruch Hu from their blasphemous claims. Yet unlike Kalev, Hur does not receive Divine protection and does end up dead because of his actions. One can't help but wonder if the midrash was inspired by Kalev - Hur's father - as an influence used to shape the midrash description of Hur's actions. Like father, like son - zealous on behalf of G-d and His honor, willing to do whatever it takes to be the first one to remonstrate any act aimed at undermining belief in HaKadosh Baruch Hu.**^[54]{.underline}^**



**Part 2: The Three Crowns**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Midrashic ingenuity and creativity has taken Hur and catapulted him from a nobody to one of the most illustrious men of his generation: prince of the tribe of Yehudah, nephew of Moshe and Aharon, son of Kalev Ben Yefuneh and Miriam, progenitor of Betzalel the gifted artisan and the eternal monarchy of David HaMelech. And Hur was noble not only by birth,**^[55]{.underline}^** but by deed: he refused to cow to mob rule seeking to overthrow Hashem and supplant Him with an idol, or perhaps even proactively confronting and attacking them, risking and sacrificing his own life in the process. His righteousness mirrored - and perhaps even inspired - the actions of his father Kalev just over a year later; Kalev was protected by G-d from meeting the same fate as his son, and as a result of his actions he merited to outlive his entire generation and enter Eretz Canaan. Why Hur was appointed alongside Aharon by Moshe is now apparent: he was their nephew, the son of Miriam, and a great leader alongside his illustrious uncles.**^[56]{.underline}^**

Revisiting that iconic scene atop the hill during the battle with Amalek, we realize there is an added significance to the imagery of Moshe, Aharon and Hur intertwined and supporting one another. They were not merely three of the highest ranking members of Bnai Yisrael, but they were siblings as well: Moshe, Aharon and Miriam, who as a woman perhaps was not able to lead in that capacity and was instead represented by her son Hur, the three children of Amram. Bitter rivalry between brothers is what caused the exile down to Egypt and the degradation of the Jewish people; unity between brothers is the secret to their salvation.**^[57]{.underline}^**

At the same time, however, this war with Bnai Yisrael's archnemesis is by its very nature not merely a battle localized by its time and context, but rather a meta-historic precedent for the very definition of what makes the Jewish people the chosen people of G-d, and as such the presence of Hur and his uncles hand-in-hand represents something fundamental to the Jewish character on a national, macro-historical scale as well. In order to understand exactly what that point is, we turn to an astute observation found in Pirkei Avot and found in several variations scattered throughout the vast library of aggadic material.

**[Torah is Primary]{.underline}**

When discussing the many utensils commanded as part of the Mishkan's construction, there are three in particular that are described with a feature unique to them:

וְעָשׂ֥וּ [אֲר֖וֹן]{.underline} עֲצֵ֣י שִׁטִּ֑ים אַמָּתַ֨יִם וָחֵ֜צִי אׇרְכּ֗וֹ וְאַמָּ֤ה וָחֵ֙צִי֙ רׇחְבּ֔וֹ וְאַמָּ֥ה וָחֵ֖צִי קֹמָתֽוֹ׃ וְצִפִּיתָ֤ אֹתוֹ֙ זָהָ֣ב טָה֔וֹר מִבַּ֥יִת וּמִח֖וּץ תְּצַפֶּ֑נּוּ [וְעָשִׂ֧יתָ עָלָ֛יו זֵ֥ר זָהָ֖ב סָבִֽיב]{.underline}׃ (שמות כה:י-יא)

The Aron, the Shulchan and the Mizbeach HaKetoret are all supposed to be made with a crown of gold around their upper rims. This curiosity was not lost on Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אָמַר רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן יוֹחָאי, שְׁלשָׁה כְּתָרִים הֵם, כֶּתֶר מַלְכוּת וְכֶתֶר כְּהֻנָּה וְכֶתֶר תּוֹרָה.
כֶּתֶר מַלְכוּת, זֶה הַשֻׁלְחָן, דִּכְתִיב בּוֹ (שמות כה, כד): זֵר זָהָב סָבִיב. כֶּתֶר כְּהֻנָּה, זֶה הַמִּזְבֵּחַ, דִּכְתִיב בּוֹ (שמות ל, ג): זֵר זָהָב סָבִיב. וְכֶתֶר תּוֹרָה זֶה הָאָרוֹן, דִּכְתִיב בּוֹ (שמות כה, יא): זֵר זָהָב סָבִיב.

לָמָּה נִכְתָּבִים זָר וְנִקְרָאִים זֵיר, אֶלָּא לוֹמַר לָךְ אִם אָדָם זוֹכֶה נַעֲשִׂים לוֹ זֵר, וְאִם לָאו זָר. וּמִפְּנֵי מָה בְּכֻלָּן כְּתִיב (שמות כה, כד) (שמות ל, ג): וְעָשִׂיתָ לוֹ, וּבָאָרוֹן כְּתִיב (שמות כה, יא): וְעָשִׂיתָ עָלָיו, לְלַמֶּדְךָ שֶׁכֶּתֶר תּוֹרָה מְעֻלָּה יוֹתֵר מִכֻּלָּן, זָכָה אָדָם לַתּוֹרָה כְּאִלּוּ זָכָה לְכֻלָּן:**^[58]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said, there are three crowns: a crown of Malchut, a crown of Kehunah, and a crown of Torah. The crown of Malchut: this is the Shulchan, as it says: 'A crown of gold around it' (Shmot 25:24). The crown of Kehunah: this is the Altar, as it says: 'A crown of gold around it' (Shmot 30:3). And the crown of Torah: this is the Aron, as it says: 'A crown of gold around it' (Shmot 25:11).

Why are they written as 'stranger' but read as 'crown'? To teach you that if a person is worthy, they can be made for him into a crown, but if not, a stranger. And why in regards to the others i.e. the Shulchan and the altar does it say: 'You shall me for it', while for the Aron it says: 'You shall make on it'? To teach you that the crown of Torah is greater than the others; if a person merits Torah, it is as if he merits all of the crowns."**^[58]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Each of these items represent an abstract concept, and the crowns which adorn them indicate those concepts are differing areas of Jewish life and leadership. The Shulchan is a symbol of wealth and greatness**^[59]{.underline}^** and as such is a fitting symbol for Malchut. Similarly, the Altar is an obvious candidate to represent the Kehunah, as it was the vehicle through which the Kohanim performed their required service and attained forgiveness for Yisrael before HaKadosh Baruch Hu.**^[60]{.underline}^** Finally, the Aron contained within it the "testimony which I shall give you" (Shmot 25:16), the two tablets of stone upon which the ten commandments were engraved and which were a microcosm for the entirety of Torah.**^[61]{.underline}^** It is to teach these very abstractions that the Torah commands the respective utensils be created with golden crowns.

This midrash also resolves two additional linguistic anomalies, both of which are also noted and developed by Rabbi Yochanan in the Talmud.**^[62]{.underline}^** Rabbis Shimon Bar Yochai and Yochanan agree on how to interpret one, while diverging somewhat on their understanding of the other. The first revolves around the tension between how a word is recorded in a Sefer Torah, and how it is pronounced. As a Sefer Torah is written without vowels, it lends itself to many different interpretations. There is significant halachic debate already in the days of the Tannaim on which takes precedence: the written tradition or the verbal tradition.**^[63]{.underline}^** In the realm of aggadah the stakes are not as high, with the two approaches often being viewed as complementary and reconcilable instead of a binary proposition. Even the plethora of ways in which a particular word can be vowelized allow for a splintering of possible explanations.**^[64]{.underline}^** The resolution offered here imitates a style found in many places throughout the aggadic corpus, namely that when two pesukim seem to suggest opposing ideas, they should be understood as follows: one refers to when something or someone is good or correct, while the other refers to when something or someone is bad or less deserving.**^[65]{.underline}^** In this case, Rabbis Shimon Bar Yochai and Yochanan agree that if a person is meritorious, these three domains manifest as crowns on his head, but if he is not they become distant strangers to him instead.

The second teaching emphasizes the centrality of Torah compared to other aspects of life. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's language is arguably stronger, placing Torah above the other crowns**^[66]{.underline}^** and even stating it is equal to all the crowns combined. Rabbi Yochanan, while still making a point of maintaining Torah's importance, stops short of raising it above the crowns of Malchut and Kehunah. His main emphasis is not the Torah's lofty stature but its accessibility: what makes the crown of Torah truly great is that anyone can claim it, unlike the other two crowns which are strictly hereditary.**^[67]{.underline}^**

Why is such strong emphasis given to Torah study over such prestigious positions so heavily emphasized by the Torah? While the polemical nature inherent in these ideas is outside the scope of this discussion, suffice it to say that there are undoubtedly social-political influences informing the Oral teachings at this time that lie within the historical shift from a Temple-based Judaism to a religion that is able to survive and thrive in exile, namely one that Rabbinic and based on study and prayer over ritual sacrifice. Chazal were assuredly interested in emphasizing both the superiority and accessibility of Torah to all Jews compared to the other crowns.**^[68]{.underline}^**

**[Biblical Triumvirate]{.underline}**

The three crowns connote positions of authority, and Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai is ostensibly using the decorative ones present in the Mishkan to highlight the political machinations of Bnai Yisrael's different branches of government throughout the history of Nevi'im, in particular the period of the Kings. These three realms were filled by specific individuals throughout the generations, and those areas of dominion were meant to interact with each other in a particular way. The crown of Malchut was filled by the actual ruler, the man or woman who led the people and exerted control over any and all political affairs. This crown was filled by various judges during the era of Shoftim and by actual kings once the monarchy was established in the days of Shaul and David. The crown of Kehunah was filled by the Kohen Gadol, one of Aharon's descendants who was chosen as the head Kohen and who was responsible for the ritual and service related to the Mishkan and eventually the Beit HaMikdash. The crown of Torah was filled by the head Navi, a spiritual figure, a prophet who received communications from HaKadosh Baruch Hu and who oftentimes had an audience with the other crowns on matters ranging from the sundry and everyday to those of righteousness and moral guidance.

There are several instances where these three crowns interacted and influenced one another in a way that was crucial to the unfolding of Jewish history during that period. Ideally the three crowns work together in unison, towards a common goal, usually in the context of the King choosing whether or not to listen to the Navi, and being either helped or hindered in his prospects by the Kohen Gadol. This was indeed the case at several critical junctures, where things went well for kings who were humble and deferred to the other crowns, and went poorly if they decided to ignore them. For example, Yoshiyahu was entirely unaware of the existence of a Sefer Torah until Hilkiyahu the Kohen Gadol showed one to him; this caused him to spearhead a mass revivalist *teshuvah* movement which, as Huldah the Nevi'ah prophesied, in turn spared him from the calamity destined to befall the kingdom after his death On the other hand, Yoshiyahu later refused to pay heed to Yirmiyahu's warning to let Pharaoh Necho pass through in peace,**^[69]{.underline}^** and his insistence to meet the Egyptian king in battle led to his untimely death (Divrei HaYamim Bet 34 and 35).

Another example is Uzziyahu, the righteous king who listened to the visions of Zechariah, prophet of G-d, and was incredibly successful against his enemies. However, he became arrogant and corrupt as a result of his strength, and refused to obey the warning of Azaryahu the Kohen Gadol not to bring incense into the Temple, that being reserved exclusively for the Kohanic descendants of Aharon; he was punished with leprosy and remained hidden away for the rest of his days until his death (Divrei HaYamim Bet 26).

Another noteworthy example of this is how Yoash was hidden away in safety as a young boy by Yehoyada the Kohen Gadol, who subsequently assisted him in gaining power and ascending the throne. As long as Yoash listened to Yehoyada and followed his mentorship, he was successful and G-d fearing. After Yehoyada's death, however, Yoash was corrupted by people in his court, and eventually condoned the murder of his son Zechariah, a man who was both a Navi and the Kohen Gadol in his own right (Divrei HaYamim Bet 24).

There are many other stories which describe this dynamic, and the text continually drills home the larger theological point: when there is discord and a lack of unity between the three crowns, disaster awaits the Jewish people. If the King does not lend an ear to the Navi - whether he is preaching a religious exhortation such as the removal of
*Avodah Zarah*, or providing a purely political suggestion such as whether the King should surrender to Bavel - HaKadosh Baruch Hu hides His face from the Jewish people. Similarly, if the King turns against the Kohen Gadol and goes his own way, it ends up leading to unwanted consequences for him. It is only when the representatives of each crown are all on the same page and dealing honestly with each other that Bnai Yisrael are also united, prosperous and righteous.

This system of checks and balances between the three crowns was the de facto leadership model which developed during Biblical times and existed until the beginning of the *Bayit Sheni* period. At that point the crown of Malchut was represented by Zerubavel - a descendant of the Davidic line - the crown of Kehunah was represented by Yehoshua the Kohen Gadol, and crown of Torah was represented by the last of the Nevi'im: Hagai, Zechariah, and Malachi, and in the early days of the return from exile the crowns all worked together in harmony as attested to by the *neviim*.**^[70]{.underline}^** These crowns are well identified throughout early Jewish history, but it is Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai who formally defines them as the official spheres of leadership on the national level. All of Bnai Yisrael, as it were, are crowned with these three things, and in each generation certain people merit to wear them.] Although only certain individuals within Bnai Yisrael are actually kings, priests and scholars, t[hese] crowns conceptually and metaphysically rest upon the entire nation.

The scope and breadth of these crowns can be applied to a sub-collective of the Jewish people as a whole; each individual belongs not just to Bnai Yisrael but also to a particular tribe, be it Kohanim from the tribe of Levi, Kings from the tribe of Yehudah, or Torah scholars from any of the twelve tribes. Is it possible that - in some sense - each of these crowns also rests upon each tribe as well?

ויבואו עד גורן האטד (בראשית נ, י) ... תנא כולם למלחמה באו, כיון שראו כתרו של יוסף תלוי בארונו של יעקב, נטלו כולן כתריהן ותלאום בארונו של יעקב.

תנא שלשים וששה כתרים נתלו בארונו של יעקב:**^[71]{.underline}^**

<div style="flex: 1;">
"'They reach the threshing floor of Atad' (Breishit 50:10) ... It was taught: They all came ready for battle, but once they saw Yosef's crown hanging on Yaakov's coffin, each the sons of Esav, Yishmael and Keturah took off his crown and also hung it on Yaakov's coffin.

It was also taught: They hung thirty-six crowns on Yaakov's coffin."**^[71]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

After Yaakov Avinu passed away Yosef organized a massive funeral procession, escorting him with an entourage including his brothers from Egypt to Eretz Canaan. The Talmud discusses how the sons of Esav, Yishmael, and Keturah came to the funeral intent on waging war with Yaakov's sons, but once they saw Yosef's crown hanging on the coffin they were placated and also hung their own crowns onto it in solidarity. The Talmud then mentions in the next line - introduced with the word *tanna*, it was taught - that 36 crowns were hung on Yaakov's coffin.

There are two ways to interpret this passage. The first way is to view the second passage as an addendum to the first, a corollary detail to the prior story. In that case, the thirty-six crowns described must have been hung by the sons of Esav, Yishmael, and Keturah; this is how Rashi explains the passage.**^[72]{.underline}^** However, it is also possible to read the second passage as an independent teaching. The Talmud is bringing it here because it is already on the subject of crowns decorating Yaakov's coffin, and so the number of crowns is directly relevant. However, the owners of those crowns do not necessarily have to be the three groups mentioned in the previous teaching.**^[73]{.underline}^**

If we accept this idea, then the 36 crowns can be interpreted as originally belonging to, not Yaakov's enemies, but his sons that accompanied his body during the burial procession. It follows that equally allocating 36 crowns among twelve tribes would indicate three crowns for each son. And while the crowns of Malchut and Kehunah cannot apply in the literal sense to tribes other than Yehuudah and Levi respectively, this imagery of three crowns for each tribe, the eponymous Bnai Yisrael, all hanging on the coffin of their father Yaakov, evokes a sense of unity and togetherness that ultimately the crowns are meant to represent in their purest form.**^[74]{.underline}^**

**[A Good Name]{.underline}**

Given Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's insistence that meriting the crown of Torah is like meriting all three crowns at once, it is somewhat surprising that elsewhere he mentions another crown being even greater:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמֵר, שְׁלשָׁה כְתָרִים הֵם, כֶּתֶר תּוֹרָה וְכֶתֶר כְּהֻנָּה וְכֶתֶר מַלְכוּת, וְכֶתֶר שֵׁם טוֹב עוֹלֶה עַל גַּבֵּיהֶן:**^[75]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Shimon said, there are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of Kehunah, and the crown of Malchut; and the crown of a good name supersedes them all."**^[75]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The crown of Torah is above the crowns of Malchut and Kehunah, but the crown of a good name is above even that of Torah. While the crowns of Kehunah and Malchut can only be inherited, the crown of Torah can be earned through study and effort; the crown of a good name can also be earned by anyone, and its reach is much greater than Torah.**^[76]{.underline}^** One variant of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's teaching has an even farther-reaching conclusion: the crown of a good name is infinitely greater than that of the others, for while the crown of Torah travels for three days, the crown of a good name has no limit and can travel infinitely far in either direction.**^[77]{.underline}^**

Combining this last variant of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's teaching found in Kohelet Rabbah with the one in Shmot Rabbah (see above **Note 56**) conveniently allows us to assign quantitative values, or points, to each of the crowns under discussion. The crowns of Kehunah and Malchut are described as the lowest-ranked and as equal to one another, similar in their hereditary nature and their having ceased to exist as proper functions with the destruction of the Beit HaMikdash. Each of these crowns is equal to one point. The crown of Torah is superior to either of the other crowns, and Shmot Rabbah informs us that one who merits it, *"it is as if he merits all of the crowns."* The crown of Torah is therefore equal to three points, since it is the sum of three individual crowns - each of which is worth one point - and larger than any one of them on its own. This assignment of three points also ties nicely into Kohelet Rabbah's source for Torah's extent as three days' journey, which it juxtaposes to a good name whose extent is infinite, surrounding the entire world.

What does *shem tov*, a good name, mean in this context, and why does it sit atop the other three crowns? The simple, straightforward understanding that a good name refers to somebody's reputation and actions.**^[78]{.underline}^** If a person is righteous and pleasant, if he is known for his kindness and he is popular and well-liked, then he has a "good name". The other three crowns are inferior to this one, because in order for somebody to be an effective leader - whether that title is inherited such as with Malchut or Kehunah, or whether it is acquired such as with Torah - he must have the trust and respect of the people he is leading. A king without a kingdom has nothing to rule.

However, there is another way to interpret the phrase *shem tov* in this midrash, namely in the spirit of its most famous application. The founder of Chassidut was known as the Ba'al Shem Tov, the master of the Good Name, and he lived in a time where there were many Ba'alei Shem wandering around in Eastern Europe. Master of the Name, or Good Name, is a reference to someone who knows how to write amulets or special scrolls that contain holy names of G-d in order to ward off evil spirits and demons. It follows that *shem tov* can also be understood to mean not "a good name" in a generic sense, but "the Good Name" is a very specific sense: a moniker for HaKadosh Baruch Hu Himself.**^[79]{.underline}^**

If understood this way, our Mishnah takes on an entirely new meaning. None of the three crowns can be successful unless they have the crown of the Good Name above them; put differently, no Jewish leader can be successful without a proper and constant recognition of G-d, without working and serving with a sense of who the King of Kings is. To use perhaps a more mundane terminology: no one can govern effectively in any branch of government unless he carries himself with a profound sense of responsibility, as a servant for a higher purpose and the greater good, namely the well-being of the people he is responsible for. For Jewish leaders this higher purpose is not just the prospering of Bnai Yisrael, but also the glorification of His Name in the world, an overabundance of good and moral behavior that the other nations of the world will apprehend and come to recognize His dominion and Name as a result.**^[80]{.underline}^** In fact, one midrashic tradition frames the requirement to erase the memory of the wicked Amalek as a prerequisite to enabling His Name and kingship to become unified in the world.**^[81]{.underline}^**

Since the crown of Torah is greater than those of Kehunah or Malchut, and given that the crown of a good name is *oleh al gabeihen*, which literally means "above them" i.e. the other three crowns, we can take this ranking scale inferred from this midrash in all of its variations and visualize it using the numerical system discussed above.**^[82]{.underline}^** It is this image which reveals the ultimate secret of Hur's character, and unlocks a powerful understanding of just how deep the thematic brilliance employed by the aggadic sages truly runs.

**[Holy Unification]{.underline}**

We have seen the concept of three crowns derived from actual things, real material utensils, items designed for the Mishkan and used in service of G-d. It was then applied to the abstract, the world of Jewish leadership and governance, the relationship between various leaders throughout the centuries in Eretz Canaan. The symbolism is explicit, its logic and meaning clear: a nation united and unified together in service of HaKadosh Baruch Hu through all the channels available to them - political and economic, material and religious, scholarly and spiritual - have the support and strength their Creator on their side; they cannot fail.

The rightful wearers of these crowns underwent numerous iterations during the rise and fall of judges and kings, priests and prophets. Yet a pressing question remains unaddressed: who were the first men to don them? Who set the precedent for what the relationship between these separate conduits to G-d could and should be? And is there a stronger connection to their original source, the foundation of these crowns in the physical world of the Mishkan?

The first person to merit donning the crown of Kehunah is undoubtedly Aharon, appointed by G-d Himself as ancestor to all Kohanim that were to bear it after him. Similarly, the first and quintessential personification of the crown of Torah is none other than Moshe Rabbeinu, the very man who brought the Torah down from Heaven, the lawgiver who taught G-d's word to Bnai Yisrael, and ensured the beginning of its successful transmission through the ages. The crowns of Kehunah and Torah were first introduced and passed on by Moshe and Aharon; it follows that the individual supposed to bear the mantle of the third crown should have been initiated at the same time.**^[82b]{.underline}^** Who, then, was the original paradigm of Malchut?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
דָּוִד נָמֵי מִמִּרְיָם קָאָתֵי דִּכְתִיב וַתָּמׇת עֲזוּבָה אֵשֶׁת כָּלֵב וַיִּקַּח לוֹ כָלֵב אֶת אֶפְרָת וַתֵּלֶד לוֹ אֶת חוּר (דברי הימים א ב, יט) וּכְתִיב וְדָוִד בֶּן אִישׁ אֶפְרָתִי וְגוֹ׳ (שמואל א יז, יב):**^[46]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
David was also descended from Miriam, as it says: 'Azuvah died, and Kalev took Efrat as a wife, and she gave birth to Hur' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:19), and it says: 'David was an Efratite' (Shmuel Aleph 17:12)**^[46]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There stands one man who perfectly fits the requirement: Hur, son of Kalev Ben Hetzron and Miriam Bat Amram. Effectively the third sibling to Moshe and Aharon on his mother's side, and effectively the ancestor to David HaMelech and the royal family tree on his father's side, Hur is the bridge between two worlds: the independent world of Malchut contained within the tribe of Yehudah, and the related worlds of Kehunah and Torah both found in the tribe of Levi. Only a man such as Hur could be the chosen one, the ultimate candidate for the crown of Malchut - he represented in his person and lineage all that the king is meant to embody and strive for on both a personal and communal level. He has intimate ties to the other crowns, by blood and by action, by word and by deed. Who is more fitting to exemplify and epitomize the third crown than Hur?

It is armed with this knowledge that a glorious, brilliant light is suddenly shed on the eternal relevance and importance of Amalek's attack in Shmot 17. Moshe, the crown prince of Torah, is seated on a rock in the middle. Aharon, the crown prince of Kehunah, is supporting his hand on one side; Hur, the crown prince of Malchut, is supporting his hand on the other. All three crowns thus make their first formal appearance embodied by these legendary figures of Jewish leadership in an idyllic realization of unshakeable unity. This more than anything else is a true *emunah ad bo hashamesh*, a symbol of faith, commitment, love and brotherhood that can overcome any struggle, is necessary to defeat the polar opposite: a symbol of randomness, disloyalty, hatred and divisiveness, the evil nation of Amalek.**^[83]{.underline}^**

Additionally, it was no accident that Moshe was seated in the middle of Aharon and Hur, nor was it an accident that the text goes out of its way to tell us this. Just as the Aron was first item to be commanded and constructed, found in the center of the Mishkan at the holiest epicenter of Divine immanence, and just as Torah is greater than either Kehunah or Malchut because of its constant availability, so too here: Hur and Aharon, while indispensable in their own areas of leadership, are subservient to Moshe, to Torah's superior nature. Only then can the human manifestation of all three crowns work in unison as co-leaders, dependent on each other, happy for one another, and not in competition but rather bonded as one.

Moshe, Aharon and Hur stand atop the hill, hands raised up to Heaven, three crowns united, yet still something is missing: Bnai Yisrael are only able to win the battle when the crowns' joined hands are stretched Heavenward. The Mishnah wonders why this was so:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וְהָיָה כַּאֲשֶׁר יָרִים משֶׁה יָדוֹ וְגָבַר יִשְׂרָאֵל וְגוֹ' (שמות יז, יא), וְכִי יָדָיו שֶׁל משֶׁה עוֹשׂוֹת מִלְחָמָה אוֹ שׁוֹבְרוֹת מִלְחָמָה. אֶלָּא לוֹמַר לְךָ, כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהָיוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִסְתַּכְּלִים כְּלַפֵּי מַעְלָה וּמְשַׁעְבְּדִין אֶת לִבָּם לַאֲבִיהֶם שֶׁבַּשָּׁמַיִם הָיוּ מִתְגַּבְּרִים. וְאִם לָאו, הָיוּ נוֹפְלִין:**^[10]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'Whenever Moshe raised his hand, Yisrael would gain the upper hand' (Shmot 17:11). Did Moshe's hands make or break a battle? Rather this teaches you that whenever Yisrael would look Heavenward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they would gain the upper hand. But if not, they would fall."**^[10]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

In order to vanquish Amalek, Bnai Yisrael had to recognize their Father in Heaven; only when they directed their eyes and hearts upward would they gain the upper hand in the fight against their enemy. Victory could not be achieved without this, no matter how unified Moshe, Aharon and Hur presented themselves as: at the end of the day it is Hashem who fights for Yisrael and ensures their success in battle. Moshe's hands directed up to Heaven symbolizes how the crown of a Good Name is above the other three crowns: our Father in Heaven is above the crowns of Torah, Kehunah and Malchut, and these are all dependent on Him in order to be successful. Only with a unification of all of Yisrael through the three crowns, combined with the ultimate unification of HaKadosh Baruch Hu, can Yisrael win and emerge on top.**^[84]{.underline}^**

The image of how all the crowns interact with each other in a numerical plane (see previous **Note 82**) thus mirrors the actual arrangement of those crowns personified during the war with Amalek. Moshe was in the middle, raised up slightly on a rock, with his hands supported on both sides by the "lesser" Aharon and Hur. However, all of them reside infinitely below the Holy Name, HaKadosh Baruch Hu's presence in Heaven, which hovers above them and acts as a source of strength and motivation for all the soldiers fighting in the field.**^[85]{.underline}^**

This rendering of Shmot 17 also allows for an innovative midrashic rereading of the psalmist's famous paise of brotherly unity:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
שִׁ֥יר הַֽמַּעֲל֗וֹת לְדָ֫וִ֥ד הִנֵּ֣ה מַה טּ֭וֹב וּמַה נָּעִ֑ים שֶׁ֖בֶת אַחִ֣ים גַּם יָֽחַד׃ כַּשֶּׁ֤מֶן הַטּ֨וֹב עַל הָרֹ֗אשׁ יֹרֵ֗ד עַֽל הַזָּקָ֥ן זְקַֽן אַהֲרֹ֑ן שֶׁ֝יֹּרֵ֗ד עַל פִּ֥י מִדּוֹתָֽיו׃ כְּטַל חֶרְמ֗וֹן שֶׁיֹּרֵד֮ עַל הַרְרֵ֢י צִ֫יּ֥וֹן כִּ֤י שָׁ֨ם צִוָּ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה אֶת הַבְּרָכָ֑ה חַ֝יִּ֗ים עַד הָעוֹלָֽם׃**^[86]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"A song of ascents, to David. Behold how good and how pleasant it is when brothers sit together. Like good oil on the head, which drips down into the beard, the beard of Aharon, that comes down over the collar of his robe. Like the dew of Hermon which comes down on the mountains of Tzion, for there Hashem commanded the blessing, everlasting life."**^[86]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Who exactly are the brothers this *mizmor* is referring to, that it celebrates their closeness so admiringly? There are several midrashic traditions which interpret "brothers" as more of a concept than a reference to actual siblings,**^[87]{.underline}^** but one prominent idea notes the reference to Aharon in his priestly function in pasuk 2, and infers from this an allusion to the beauty of Aharon and Moshe's happiness for one another's greatness. Each was given a position of honor, and each was not jealous over what the other received.**^[88]{.underline}^** This, as Tanchuma HaKadum notes acerbically, is the exception rather than the norm, as brothers tend to be competitive and unwilling to cooperate with one another.**^[89]{.underline}^**

Expanding on this idea, we can now understand this *mizmor* as referring to a specific incident in Moshe and Aharons' life: the battle with Amalek in Shmot 17. Hur is the third brother of Moshe and Aharon, the heir and representative of Miriam; he is included in the designation of brothers. The three crowns are all together, and only because of that fact are Moshe's hands able to remain steady and Bnai Yisrael are able to gain the upper hand. Initially Moshe tells Yehoshua that: *"I* w*ill stand at the top of the hill"* (Shmot 17:9), yet in the end it requires too much effort, and Moshe ends up sitting down on a rock: *"And he sat on it"* (Shmot 17:12). Moshe Rabbeinu sitting down, his brothers Aharon and Hur holding onto him as a single unit: this is truly שבת אחים גם יחד, where the three brothers are literally sitting together, unified as one.

Alternatively, we can expand the concept of brothers even further and suggest an alternate reading informed by invoking the aggadic principle of *notrikon* (נוטריקון), or acronym. The word אחים can be read as ראשי תיבות for the names of the four leaders mentioned in Shmot 17:

א = אהרון
ח = חור
י = יהושע
ם = משה

Including Yehoshua zooms out the scope of brothers from blood relatives to the more metaphorical brothers-in-arms, though as we mentioned there is midrashic precedent to interpret the word "brothers" here in the non-literal sense. Yehoshua, too, was an essential player in our drama, and he too needed to be together with Moshe and the others. It is this all-encompassing power of unity, symbolic and military combined, which must be harnessed in order to prevail over an enemy as daunting and ruthless as Amalek.

A third possibility is to slightly alter the נוטריקון in light of Mishnah Rosh HaShanah's insight into Moshe's actions (see above **Note 85**) and shift the value of the *yud* in the word אחים:

א = אהרון
ח = חור
י = יקוק
ם = משה

Now it is Moshe, Aharon and Hur who are all joined with Hashem Himself atop the mountain; it is G-d Himself, dwelling together with His chosen ones, who are described as good and pleasant by the *mizmor*. All four crowns of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, including the crown of a Good Name, are necessary to successfully eradicate evil.**^[90]{.underline}^**



**Part 3: Divine Justice**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Perhaps more than any other, these midrashim all dance around the singular question of what makes somebody a leader. There are two basic models of how a leader should be chosen, and the Torah oscillates back and forth between them, oftentimes embracing the tension between them and using the dynamic engendered by their conflict to flesh out the complexities hiding the benefits and faults of each one. The first portrait of a leader is that of somebody born into the job. Dynastic inheritance, ranging from monarchical absolutism to levitical priesthood, the primacy of firstborn - all these speak to a belief that being born into a certain caste predestines a man to a certain position in society. This concept suffers from delegitimizing man's character as a very real qualifying aspect of his ability to lead effectively. The other perspective weighs a persons' actions and character as primary: a leader is not born, but made. In the most extreme form, this concept requires a leader to come from the outside, to be excluded, in order to earn his way into the halls of power. A person born into privilege cannot earn that position since he was given it for free to begin with; effectively, this idea punishes those fortunate to be born into leadership as unworthy of rule.

Both models have their merits, but alone each one is incomplete, rewarding some at the expense of others and giving preference unfairly. The Torah recognizes this, and therefore does not propose a one-size-fits-all model for leadership, instead striking a balance, telling stories of both great heroes and colossal failures from both models while never directly addressing the question head on, letting the stories paint a grayer and more nuanced picture. Avraham, Moshe, Aharon, David, heads and founders of new eras in Jewish history - these men were not born into greatness, but rather chosen for it by G-d. Commanded, coerced and anointed, each had his own story, yet they all shared a common iconoclastic undercurrent, shaping their own respective destinies and defining the greatness that was to follow them on their own terms, all while knowing full well their success was contingent on G-d's blessing and approval. Yet Yitzchak, Yaakov, Pinchas, the righteous kings of Davidic descent such as Chizkiyahu or Yoshiyahu - these are men who also merited the mantle leadership, even though it came to them through nepotism and birth status, but would not necessarily have been effective leaders had it not been given to them at the outset. Does a leader need to fight for his position, to protest the presumed fate given to him by birth and redefining what his fate actually is? Or are some people deserving of greatness because of circumstance, environment, destiny?

Two portraits of Hur have emerged from the midrashim which use him as a microcosm symbolizing these varied expectations for leadership. Hur was born into greatness, at the nexus of the Levitic elite and the seeds of monarchic royalty. Similarly, his grandson Betzalel was destined from the beginning of the world to build the Mishkan, and was showered with wisdom, insight and knowledge from above. Yet at the same time it was action which demonstrated Hur's right to rule: He was loyal to G-d, defending Him in the face of certain death, and having been tested in a way most people are not, proved his merits as a leader. Similarly, Betzalel demonstrates an ability to apply his wisdom in a way that retroactively seems to justify his lofty position.**^[91]{.underline}^** Clearly, then, the answer is not one model or the other, but a combination of both; while the two approaches are different, they can easily be seen as complementary instead of contradictory.

The dichotomy between a leader being born and raised and therefore "pre-chosen" versus a leader charting his own path and meriting his legacy is meant to teach us an important lesson regarding leadership: In the eyes of the Torah, both are true, and ideally both are found in the same person. The Torah is unapologetic on the following point: there is absolutely value and merit, on some level and in some sense, to an inherited relationship. For evidence look no further than the good kings and Kohanim that appear later in Tanach. Lineage and birthright are important concepts in Biblical, and to a lesser extent Rabbinic, Judaism, and it plays heavily into how many leaders enshrined in the national consciousness were chosen. Even though David was anointed and had to fight tooth and nail to carve out the monarchy for himself, he was simultaneously still somehow, paradoxically, descended from the very tribe that had to rule. While this idea may be less palatable to modern Western sensibilities, it cannot be dismissed and discarded wholesale. To take the idea one step further: surely there are some people, all things being equal, whose personalities and genetics make them more suitable for rule than others. Yet their looks and even their predispositions towards certain characteristics - charisma, self-confidence and assuredness - are not distributed fairly; surely they shall not be penalized because they were born with certain advantages? In the same breath, however, this model alone runs the very real risk of nepotism and "bad apples" as is evidenced by the bad kings and priests who sprung up throughout the generations.

In other words, the midrashic literature acknowledges the pros and cons of both models, while advocating as an ideal a leader who meets both sets of criteria, He knows about nobility, can play politics, and has been taught to understand and experience the demands of leadership. But, at the same time he personally acts with, and demonstrates, the proper character to rule. By casting Hur as symbolizing the crown of Malchut yet also dying *al kiddush hashem*, the midrash is lifting him up as the quintessential leader in both respects, the ultimate combination of birthright and before the fact, and justification afterwards.

This perspective thrusts the ever-important question of theodicy in even sharper focus. Why was Hur, the quintessential leader who had all the benefits of both birth and virtue, allowed to die a tragic death? Was Hur ever rewarded for his laudable sacrifice? What form did this reward take? Was it of this world - *olam hazeh*, of another world - *olam haba*, or perhaps of both?

**[National Atonement]{.underline}**

The rules surrounding building the Mishkan play a central role in the Torah, spanning several parshiyot and expending much effort in detailing all the smallest minutiae that accompanied its development. Yet the order in which the text records it is famously difficult, for the story of the golden calf seemingly breaks apart an otherwise logical and cohesive whole: the laws are conveyed to Moshe before the people sin, but they are only put into practice afterwards. Is this told chronologically, and Moshe was commanded to build the Mishkan before Bnai Yisrael went astray, or is it told out of order, and even the initial command was only communicated after the golden calf episode had transpired?

This famous question is subject to a debate between two of the most prominent Rishonim. Ramban argues that we should always assume the Torah is written in the order we find it in for a reason, unless there is a compelling reason to think otherwise. Therefore, we should conclude that the Mishkan's construction was decreed by HaKadosh Baruch Hu before the golden calf,**^[92]{.underline}^** which would imply that the Mishkan's purpose is simply as a place of worship where G-d can allow His presence to dwell in this world.

Rashi disagrees, invoking the aggadic principle that *ein mukdam ume'uchar batorah***^[93]{.underline}^** in order to dismiss Ramban's concern. He is not without precedent, as the midrashim themselves make this point as well:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה. מעשה העגל קודם לציווי מלאכת המשכן ימים רבים היה, שהרי בשבעה עשר בתמוז נשתברו הלוחות, וביום הכיפורים נתרצה הקב"ה לישראל, ולמחרת התחילו בנדבת המשכן והוקם באחד בניסן:**^[94]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"There is no chronological order in the Torah. The incident with the calf happened many days before the command to build the Mishkan, for the tablets were broken on the 17th of Tammuz, and on Yom Kippur the 10th of Tishrei HaKadosh Baruch Hu was appeased regarding Yisrael, and on the next day they began with donations for the Mishkan, and it was established on the 1st of Nissan of the following year."**^[94]{.underline}^**

"'They shall make a holy place for Me, and I shall dwell among them' (Shmot 25:28). When was this section about the Mishkan said to Moshe? On Yom Kippur itself, even though this section about the Mishkan comes before the incident with the calf. Rabbi Yehudah BeRabbi Shalom says, there is no chronological order to the Torah, as it says: 'Her ways wander, but she doesn't know it' (Mishlei 5:6) - the things that move around are the paths and sections of the Torah. So, on Yom Kippur it was said to Moshe: 'They shall make a holy place for Me'. How do we know this? Moshe went up Har Sinai on the 6th of Sivan, and he was there for 40 days and 40 nights, and then he did another 40 days, and then he did another 40 days, which totals 120 days. So you find that Bnai Yisrael were atoned for on Yom Kippur, and on that day HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'They shall make a holy place for Me, and I shall dwell among them', so that all the nations will know that they have been atoned for regarding the incident with the calf. That is why it is referred to as: 'Mishkan of testimony' (Shmot 38:29), for it is a testimony to all the nations that HaKadosh Baruch Hu dwells in your Mishkan. HaKadosh Baruch Hu said, may the gold of the Mishkan come and atone for the gold that was used to make the calf, as it says: 'The whole nation removed their golden earrings' (Shmot 32:3). That is why their atonement is also through gold: 'And this is the donation you shall take from them - gold, etc.' HaKadosh Baruch Hu said: 'I will restore health to you, and heal your wounds' (Yirmiyahu 30:17)."**^[95]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

As it often does, here Tanchuma Yelamdenu explicitly spells out the reason motivating a certain midrashic exegesis, even when in older versions of the same tradition that motivation is only implied and meant to be read between the lines.**^[96]{.underline}^** The Mishkan must have been commanded after the sin of the golden calf, because it its primary function was as a vehicle of forgiveness for that very sin. It would have been unfathomable in the eyes of the midrash to claim - as Ramban does - that the Mishkan's construction was unrelated to the catastrophic national failure wedged right in between its instructions and execution; surely HaKadosh Baruch Hu's forgiveness of the people must have gone beyond the simple act of deciding not to destroy them.**^[97]{.underline}^** The Mishkan was not just a vessel to house the Shechinah's presence, a place to offer sacrifices and perform rituals. It served a higher purpose, one necessary to elevate the people, erase the blemish that has stained them since the golden calf was created and worshiped, and rekindle an active relationship with their Creator.

**[Paying It Forward]{.underline}**

If the Mishkan's primary purpose was as expiation for the sin of the golden calf as the aggadah declares, where does Betzalel fit into that process? He was called by name to head the construction of G-d's Tabernacle, and while one school of thought argues this designation was from the beginning of time, another approach is to see in the appointment of Betzalel - grandson of Hur Ben Hetzron - a reward to Hur for his actions during that infamous episode:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"'See, Hashem has called by name Betzalel Ben Uri Ben Hur'. Why does it mention Hur here? Because when Yisrael wanted to worship Avodah Zarah, Hur gave his life for HaKadosh Baruch Hu and did not let them until they stood up and killed him. HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to him, by your life I will pay you back. A parable: A king whose legions rebelled against him. His general got up and fought against them, saying: You are rebelling against the king. They stood up and killed him. The king then said: If he had given me money I would have to pay him back, how much more so that he has given his life over me. What shall I do for him? I will make all children that come from him great leaders. So too when Yisrael made the calf, Hur got up and gave his life over HaKadosh Baruch Hu, who said to him: By your life, all children that come from you - I shall increase their good name in the world, as it says: 'See, Hashem has called by name Betzalel', 'He is filled with the spirit of G-d'."**^[98]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

If the Mishkan is a direct response to the incident of the golden calf, who better to take the lead and be appointed in charge of its design than Betzalel, the grandson of Hur? Is that not an appropriate way to commemorate Hur's death and ensure atonement for all of Bnai Yisrael, which thereby fulfills Hur's mission of protecting the people from sin, albeit through *teshuva* rather than preventing the sin to begin with?**^[99]{.underline}^**

Additionally, Hashem wished to show the people not only that He had forgiven them for the grievous sin of *Avodah Zarah*; He had forgiven them for the murder of His servant Hur as well. Having his grandson engineer the vehicle of His presence among the people, signifying His acceptance of their return to Him, demonstrates to Bnai Yisrael that through their contributions and enthusiasm for the Mishkan they have achieved atonement for Hur's gruesome death.

Let us direct our attention to the end of Shmot Rabbah. How specifically does HaKadosh Baruch Hu promise to pay Hur back for his fidelity? By noticing Hur's offspring and being "*megadlam shem tov baolam"*, increasing their good name in the world. We see here the appearance of a *shem tov*, a good name, and the midrash is imparting the reward ensured by G-d: although Hur had been reviled by the people, his children and offspring will be beloved by Bnai Yisrael.

However, the phrase "a good name", as discussed earlier in relation to the three crowns, can also mean the name of G-d, and symbolize His active presence and intervention in the world. If so, this underlines a powerful answer to the accusations of צדיק ורע לו. While Hur was being murdered at the bottom of Har Sinai, HaKadosh Baruch Hu was hidden, seemingly absent, unwilling to intervene and protect his loyal prince. His revenge and payback is therefore the complete opposite of *hester panim*: He personally calls Betzalel, grandson by name, something He rarely does, to highlight how He is involved, how He does care about the fates of His loved ones and pays them back, if not during their lives, then in the lives of their descendants.

We can therefore interpret the words of Shmot Rabbah to mean as follows: HaKadosh Baruch Hu is promising that He will increase, through the children of Hur, His Good Name in the world. Sometimes it is hard to see G-d and His hand playing a role in the world when bad things happen to good people, but know, the midrash comforts us, that *"I will pay you back"*. Have faith that just as Hur was rewarded for his righteousness, you too will be rewarded; just as Betzalel was called by name as the descendant of his grandfather Hur, so too HaKadosh Baruch Hu will shower goodness and a Good Name upon your family if you follow in His ways. In effect, then, this aggadic tradition is arguing for a Divine Presence, the ultimate *keter shem tov*, and comforting its readers by saying: while at times it may be hard to see G-d in the world on a personal or even a national level, there is a system of justice in the world, and there will come a time in the days of your descendants where the truth of this system will make itself clear. This idea is a cornerstone of the Rabbinic philosophy and belief, and by weaving the threads of Hur, Betzalel, Kalev, Aharon and Moshe together our midrash lays the groundwork for an important message about Divine Justice.

This idea is buttressed by the Kabbalistic teaching that after leaving his body, Hur's soul enclothed the soul of his father Kalev, and it was that which drove Kalev to act in a similar manner later on during the episode with the spies:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
נשמתו של חור נתלבשה בנשמת כלב, זה סוד ועבדי כלב עקב היתה רוח אחרת עמו (במדבר יד, כד), רו"ח אותיות חור:**^[100]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The soul of Hur was bound up in the soul of Kalev. This is the secret of: 'My servant Kalev had another spirit with him' (Bemidbar 14:24) - the word for spirit has the same letters as Hur."**^[100]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Not only were Kalev and Hur father and son, but Kalev carried on Hur's legacy by standing up against the other spies. Hur was taken unjustly, before his time, and never had the chance to be "laid to rest" or redeemed in any recognizable way. It is to this larger point that the midrash is hyper-attuned to, and seeks to understand the ramifications from a hashkafic perspective: How are we to make sense of Hur's untimely death in the face of such wanton tragedy? The parallel to Kalev Ben Yefuneh's actions, along with the noteworthy description of Kalev has having been possessed by a *"different spirit"* when he acted the way he did, leads Yalkut Reuveni to draw the natural conclusion: Hur was actually acting through Kalev, and this time his zealotry was rewarded: he was to survive, enter Eretz Canaan and inherit Hevron: the city where Avraham Yitzchak and Yaakov were buried (Breishit 23:19, 49:29), and the place where his descendant David was initially recognized and crowned as king over the tribe of Yehudah (Shmuel Bet 2:4). Although Hur's life was cut short by Bnai Yisrael at the sin of the golden calf, his legacy - indeed, his very soul**^[101]{.underline}^** - lived on through his father, one of only two people who outlived G-d's promise that Bnai Yisrael were destined to die in the desert.

Although Hur was condemned to death because of his fidelity to HaKadosh Baruch Hu, in reality his essence outlived the rest of his generation. Kalev entering Eretz Yisrael represents Hashem fulfilling His promise to the Avot, and Kalev inheriting Hevron, the site of future Davidic rule, represents Hashem fulfilling His promise to the tribe of Yehudah.**^[102]{.underline}^** Hur, though he lay slain before Aharon, lived on in the metaphorical sense - and even the literal sense - beyond Aharon: while his convictions got him killed, they also enshrined him and ensured his legacy would continue. And this in turn, shows how HaKadosh Baruch Hu rewards His righteous servants and runs His world with justice and fairness, even if it is not something easily recognizable. Indeed, it is precisely because it is not readily apparent to the eye that the seeds of such blessing can be planted, to grow and blossom. Aharon saw Hur slaughtered before his eyes, yet it was with that which was "hidden from the eye"**^[103]{.underline}^** that Hur's blessing was able to come to fruition, to receive Divine repayment for his loyalty and receive everlasting life and a portion in HaKadosh Baruch Hu's chosen land.

**[Like Children]{.underline}**

Grandchildren are just as, if not more, precious to grandparents as their own children, a sentiment any grandparent can attest to.**^[104]{.underline}^** Children cause their parents much heartache and stress, while grandchildren are pure joy and enjoyment.**^[105]{.underline}^** While this emotional feeling is certainly meaningful, there is halachic debate as to whether this concept has any legal validity;**^[106]{.underline}^** and if so, whether can be applied to the mitzvah of procreation:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"It was taught: Rabbi Natan says, Beit Shammai say two boys are required to fulfill the mitzvah of procreation while Beit Hillel say a boy and a girl ...

It was taught: Grandchildren are like children. Abaye wanted to derive from this that a person fulfills the mitzvah to procreate even if his children die if his son has a son, if his daughter has a daughter, and all the more so if his daughter has a son, but not if his son has a daughter. Rava said to him, we require: 'He formed the world to be inhabited' (Yishayahu 45:18), and here that stands i.e. a son who has a daughter and passes away, she can take his place in order to fulfill the mitzvah. Regardless, everyone agrees that two grandchildren from one child is not enough. But is it not? Did the Rabbis not say to Rav Sheshet, marry a woman and have sons, and he responded to them, the sons of my daughters are my sons indicating that one can fulfill the mitzvah to have a son and a daughter through grandchildren? There Rav Sheshet was pushing them off, for Rav Sheshet had become impotent from the lectures of Rav Huna which were very long and Rav Sheshet did not relieve himself.

Rabbah said to Rava Bar Mari, where do we know that which the Rabbis said, that grandchildren are like children? If you will say from here: 'The girls are my daughters and the boys are my sons' (Breishit 31:43), then when it continues: 'And your flocks are my flocks' does it mean that as well? Rather, Lavan is saying that you acquired them from me; so too here regarding your children you acquired them from me. Rather, say from here: 'Afterwards Hetzron came to the daughter of Machir, the father of Gilad, and she gave birth to Seguv' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2:21), and it says: 'Out of Machir descended governors' (Shoftim 5:14), and it says: 'Yehuudah is my governor' (Tehillim 60:9) i.e. these governors, who were from the tribe of Yehudah, were also called the sons of Machir, who was from the tribe of Menashe; this is because they were the children of Machir's daughter and Hetzron, indicating that grandchildren are like children."**^[107]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

All Jewish men are required to have at least two children, a boy and a girl,**^[108]{.underline}^** yet what if a man's children pass away during his lifetime: has he fulfilled his obligation? Grandchildren are in fact able to "replace" their children and enable their grandparents to perform this mitzvah under certain conditions.**^[109]{.underline}^** The source for this principle that grandchildren are considered like children should be a familiar one: Hetzron - son of Peretz, and grandson of Yehudah - had grandchildren who are considered as his own children by Divrei HaYamim Aleph. Surely, then, the same principle would apply to Hetzron's own descendant, namely his son Hur: Just as Hetzron's grandsons are considered as his sons, Hur's grandson Betzalel should be considered as his own son. This perhaps strengthens the larger point that Hur was rewarded for his actions through his descendants: although technically it was Hur's grandson who received honor and was "called by name" because of Hur, Betzalel was in practice considered like Hur's own son. It other words: Hur's soul - indeed, his essential nature of zealousness and loyalty towards Hashem - enclothed his father Kalev, who was subsequently rewarded with entry to Eretz Canaan and an inheritance in Hevron the land of his forefathers; and Hur's good name passed onto his son/grandson Betzalel, who was subsequently honored as the main artisan of the Mishkan, meant to house G-d's presence in this world.

Mishlei juxtaposes the concept of a male grandchild with that of a crown:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
עֲטֶ֣רֶת זְ֭קֵנִים בְּנֵ֣י בָנִ֑ים וְתִפְאֶ֖רֶת בָּנִ֣ים אֲבוֹתָֽם׃**^[110]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The crown of the elderly is their sons' sons, and the beauty of sons is their father."**^[110]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This pasuk is applied to the righteous and demonstrates how just as Yaakov inherited the beauty of Avraham, Avraham was retroactively crowned by Yaakov.**^[111]{.underline}^** This language of crowning adds yet another layer of depth to Hur's reward. Hur's crown was the crown of Kingship, and here we see that male grandchildren - considered like children - inherit the crowns of their grandparents. Hur's crown of leadership was realized by Betzalel being chosen to construct the Mishkan; in effect he retroactively, even in death, was both crowned through his offspring and passed his own crown dynastically onto his child, just as kings are expected to do in death.**^[112]{.underline}^** Hur's spirit lived on through his father Kalev, and his crown was passed onto his "son" Betzalel; just as the midrash portrays him as the quintessential leader, both in pedigree and in performance, it also demonstrates how he is the quintessential model of someone who suffers but is rewarded in ways that are not immediately recognizable but, upon reflection and with the proper faith in the Divine order, become self-apparent.

**[Final Vengeance]{.underline}**

We have seen so far the name Hur appear in two distinct contexts: (1) Shmot 17 and Shmot 24 in reference to Aharon's colleague and leader of Bnai Yisrael, and (2) Shmot 31, Divrei HaYamim Aleph 2, and many other places in reference to the son of Kalev Ben Hetzron and the grandfather of Betzalel.

The name Hur comes up in several other places in Tanach as well as people's names,**^[113]{.underline}^** though those references do not appear related and the aggadic literature does not attempt to consolidate them the same way it does in the other instances.**^[114]{.underline}^** There is, however, one other association with the word Hur that refers, not to a person, but to a thing:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וּבִמְל֣וֹאת ׀ הַיָּמִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה עָשָׂ֣ה הַמֶּ֡לֶךְ לְכׇל הָעָ֣ם הַנִּמְצְאִים֩ בְּשׁוּשַׁ֨ן הַבִּירָ֜ה לְמִגָּ֧דוֹל וְעַד קָטָ֛ן מִשְׁתֶּ֖ה שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֑ים בַּחֲצַ֕ר גִּנַּ֥ת בִּיתַ֖ן הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃ ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּתְכֵ֗לֶת אָחוּז֙ בְּחַבְלֵי ב֣וּץ וְאַרְגָּמָ֔ן עַל גְּלִ֥ילֵי כֶ֖סֶף וְעַמּ֣וּדֵי שֵׁ֑שׁ מִטּ֣וֹת ׀ זָהָ֣ב וָכֶ֗סֶף עַ֛ל רִֽצְפַ֥ת בַּהַט וָשֵׁ֖שׁ וְדַ֥ר וְסֹחָֽרֶת׃ וְהַשְׁקוֹת֙ בִּכְלֵ֣י זָהָ֔ב וְכֵלִ֖ים מִכֵּלִ֣ים שׁוֹנִ֑ים וְיֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּיַ֥ד הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃**^[115]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"At the end of many days, the king hosted a banquet for seven days in the court of the king's palace garden for all the people who lived in the capital of Shushan, high and low alike. There were hangings of Hur, fine cotton and blue wool, caught up by cords of fine linen and purple wool to silver rods and alabaster columns; and there were couches of gold and silver on a pavement of marble, alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mosaics. Royal wine was served in abundance, as befits a king, in golden chalices, chalices of varied design."**^[115]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

What does the word 'Hur' mean in this context? The same letters in Aramaic are a root that means *white*; specifically, pure white, like snow or sheep's wool.**^[116]{.underline}^** Indeed, that is how the Amora Shmuel understands the word Hur in Esther as well, while Rav deems it a cognate of a Hebrew root meaning *hole*:**^[117]{.underline}^**

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
(אסתר א, ו) חור כרפס ותכלת מאי חור רב אמר חרי חרי ושמואל אמר מילת לבנה הציע להם ... איש יהודי היה בשושן הבירה (אסתר ב, ה) \... קרי ליה יהודי אלמא מיהודה קאתי וקרי ליה ימיני אלמא מבנימין קאתי אמר רב נחמן מרדכי מוכתר בנימוסו היה אמר רבה בר בר חנה אמר רבי יהושע בן לוי אביו מבנימין ואמו מיהודה:**^[118]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'Hur, fine cotton and blue' (Esther 1:6). What is Hur? Rav said, a fabric fashioned with lots of holes. Shmuel said, Achashverosh spread out for them carpets of white wool ... 'There was a man from Yehudah in the capital of Shushan' (Esther 2:5) ... Mordechai is called a Yehudi from the tribe of Yehudah, so apparently he was from Yehudah, yet he is called a Yemini from the tribe of Binyamin? Rav Nachman said, Mordechai was crowned with an honorary title. Rabbah Bar Bar Hanna said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi, Mordechai's father was from Binyamin and his mother was from Yehudah."**^[118]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Hur is the first word on a long list of descriptive phrases intended to portray the lavishness of Achashverosh's feast. Additionally, the word Hur is somewhat unique in that the masoretic tradition has the first letter ח written larger than all the other letters. In general, large and small masoretic letters are subject to midrashic interpretation, and this ח should be no exception.**^[119]{.underline}^** The large ח which opens and begins the list of adjectives describing how grand and ostentatious the banquet was further emphasizes the sense of royalty and grandeur the party was meant to convey to all of its participants. Yet perhaps there is also another layer of meaning hidden here which ties the concepts of royalty, kingship, even gold - all prominent in Megillat Esther - to the original Hur, noble wearer of the crown of Kingship.

As noted above, Mordechai is described as both a descendant of Binyamin and Yehudah. One solution offered is that Mordechai's *"father was from Binyamin and his mother was from Yehudah"*. His paternal lineage is provided by the text, making his connection to Binyamin indisputable. At the same time, the aggadah understands his mother as belonging to the tribe of Yehudah, the tribe of kingship and royalty. It is attempting to infuse an important Jewish leader with the force and authority of leadership that the tribe of Yehudah commands and connotes. In this respect, the midrash here in Megillah does to Mordechai's character what it did to Hur elsewhere: it connects someone who is clearly an important leader, but without any apparent connection to the paradigmatic tribe of leadership, to that very tribe, while still maintaining their connection to another important tribe through their second parent, namely the tribes of Binyamin and Levi respectively.

The Talmud suggests another explanation for why Mordechai is described as an *ish yehudi*. He was not actually a descendant of the tribe of Yehudah on his mother's side; rather, the term *yehudi* is an epithet of honor and distinction. The language used to describe this is striking: *"Mordechai was crowned with an honorary title"*. This crowning was figurative in the sense that he was a man of distinction, renown and respect, rightfully earning a place in the canon of leadership, the domain of the tribe of Yehudah.

What made Mordechai so deserving of this title, normally reserved for the kings of Yehudah? He refused to bow down to anyone - or anything - other than HaKadosh Baruch Hu. Mordechai was unwilling to prostrate himself before Haman,**^[120]{.underline}^** even at great personal risk. This reflects Hur's actions many generations earlier, when he also refused to participate in idolatry against the prevailing opinion of the time. These two men, separated by many hundreds of years, were both examples of decision-makers who refused to compromise their beliefs, and took the mantle of responsibility upon themselves in situations of potential uncertainty and catastrophe. Both were great leaders, both stood up to the Jewish masses and to Amalek, and both were eventually honored by their nation and by HaKadosh Baruch Hu.

Not only did Mordechai balk at the mere thought of bowing down to Haman, he was also adamant in his dedication to other mitzvot. Unless all the other Jews of his generation who enjoyed the feast of Achashverosh,**^[121]{.underline}^** Mordechai would not consume any non-Kosher food or drink.**^[122]{.underline}^** This behavior of refusing to eat non-Kosher food is also symbolically a tie to the kingdom of Yehudah, for another important figure from that tribe Daniel acted similarly when presented with non-Kosher food from the royal palace.**^[123]{.underline}^** Again we see Mordechai echoing the deeds of great men from the tribe of Yehudah, from royal stock: he truly was an *ish yehudi*.

The most pronounced thematic thread tying Mordechai and Hur together, however, is undoubtedly that they share a common enemy: Amalek. Hur is introduced on the battlefield, in the first instance in Tanach where Amalek is mentioned. Mordechai is also locked in combat with the wicked Haman, descendant of Agag, king of Amalek, the last instance in Tanach where Amalek is mentioned. Hur was only able to assist in the defeat of Amalek because of the crown of Kingship granted to him at that very moment, just as Mordechai was only able to defeat Haman because he too was crowned with the title of *yehudi*, a man from the tribe of Yehudah, either literally through his mother, or figuratively through his actions.

And yet, when it comes to Amalek, defeat always comes at the hand of the children of Rachel: Yehoshua, from the tribe of Ephraim, commands Bnai Yisrael to victory during the era of Hur, while Mordechai, from the tribe of Binyamin through his father, defeats Haman and destroys the seed of Amalek, finishing the job that Yehoshua and Hur began. As great as Hur was, Amalek's destiny was intertwined with the offspring of Rachel: Ephraim, Menashe and Binyamin. Ultimately it had to be members of those select tribes - from Yehoshua to Shaul to Mordechai - who were destined to stamp out the evil of Amalek; indeed, this was a decree issued in Heaven from the moment Yehoshua took up arms in Rephidim.**^[124]{.underline}^** The justice is poetic: the enemy which attacked the weak stragglers in the back of the camps, instead of facing the strong soldiers leading in the front, deserve to be weakened and exterminated by the descendants of the one who had been placed last, in the rear of the camp.**^[125]{.underline}^** And yet, although the children of Rachel are the ones locked in eternal combat with Amalek, the tribe of Yehudah also has a role to play in their defeat, as demonstrated through the leadership of Hur and Mordechai.**^[126]{.underline}^**

"And He said to Moshe, ascend to Hashem: You, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu and seventy elders of Yisrael, and bow down to Me from afar ... Moshe, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu and seventy elders of Yisrael ascended. They saw the G-d of Yisrael, and underneath His legs was like a pavement made of sapphire, like the essence of the sky in purity. And He did not send His hand against the nobility of Bnai Yisrael; they perceived G-d, ate and drank." (Shmot 24: 1, 9-11)
</div>
</div>

Perhaps no single episode in all of Jewish history can be considered more fundamental than that of *ma'amad har sinai*. And yet, despite this story's centrality to Jewish faith and tradition, the Torah itself records two very distinct accounts of Divine revelation, and separated by several chapters no less. The more famous account, found in Shmot 20, is bombastic, theatrical, and overwhelming. The pinnacle of religious experience enshrined and retold for generations: the Creator spoke directly to the entire Jewish nation, declaring and revealing Himself to them in a sensory encounter so overwhelming that the entire cosmos was forced into stillness; independent existence was silenced and nullified by the sheer power of HaKadosh Baruch Hu's utterance.**^[127]{.underline}^**

Shmot 24 describes a much different revelation: impersonal, not personal; elitist, not egalitarian. Shrouded in mystery and esotericism, the revelation is theophanic: the G-d of Yisrael appears to a select group of nobility, who upon seeing Him proceed to eat and drink. The description is mystical, other-worldly; we do not understand the true nature of this experience, and any meaningful context explaining what led up to it is conspicuously lacking. These select pesukim raise several questions that historically bothered many an aggadic interpreter. In particular: Shmot 24:1 states that the *atzilei bnai yisrael* are commanded to *'bow down from afar'.* Was the fact that they beheld G-d on His throne up close seen as good, or improper? The text is ambiguous: what does it mean that *'He did not send His hand against the nobility of Bnai Yisrael'* - are they being rewarded, or punished? And why did they subsequently partake in eating and drinking, in some sense the ultimate paradigm of a corporeal, animalistic act?**^[128]{.underline}^**

There is another glaring question which demands our attention as well: the nobles observed G-d directly, and survived; yet man is not able to *"see Me and live" (Shmot 33:20)*.**^[129]{.underline}^** Indeed, Bnai Yisrael feared for their lives after hearing the Ten Commandments;**^[130]{.underline}^** for how could they, mere mortals of flesh and blood, possibly rendezvous with G-d Himself, creator and master of the universe? And they are not alone: there are other examples of people terrified of death because they suspect themselves of having observed G-d.**^[131]{.underline}^** Clearly, the ineluctable death awaiting one who G-d chooses to reveal Himself to was common knowledge in those days. How did the nobles of Bnai Yisrael escape their encounter with the Divine unscathed?

When the order of stories recorded in the Torah is difficult to understand, two medieval giants of Torah commentary place themselves into two different camps: Ramban tends towards a chronological reading unless forced to do otherwise, while Rashi is quick to invoke the aggadic principle of *ein mukdam ume'uchar batorah*.**^[132]{.underline}^** The Torah's parallel, but distinct, descriptions of Matan Torah are no exception: whereas Rashi is comfortable placing Shmot 24 on the 4th of Sivan, two days prior to the giving of the Torah recorded in Shmot 20,**^[133]{.underline}^** Ramban is inclined to place it on the 7th of Sivan, one day afterwards.**^[134]{.underline}^** Each one has midrashic precedent to support his respective view, as both approaches can be found scattered throughout the earlier midrashim. Critically, however, the argument revolves around the logistics of those most exceptional days, the technicalities of what happened when, in what order. All *mefarshim* agree that Shmot 20 and Shmot 24 happened in close proximity to one another.

The Ten Commandments are rehashed by Moshe a second time in Devarim 5, albeit with slight variations, but are then never mentioned again in Tanach.**^[135]{.underline}^** We do find another example of revelation at Har Sinai, namely Eliyahu's journey as told in Melachim Aleph 19. Upon close examination it becomes clear that, rather than paralleling the national telling of Shmot 20, Eliyahu's experience more closely resembles that of Moshe and the nobility in Shmot 24.**^[136]{.underline}^** Yet notwithstanding the above, there is surprisingly little mention of what happened on Har Sinai after the revelation is complete; an implication or consequence of the nobles perceiving G-d and His sapphire footstool is nowhere to be found. Could it really be that such a bizarre, intense and surreal story, while pithy and terse, is relayed merely for its own sake, without any ramifications for those involved? The midrashic perspective cannot tolerate such a rich story being devoid of any noticeable after-effects; it cannot accept such a pivotal story in which no less than G-d and all the leaders of Bnai Yisrael are involved does not have relevance or repercussions beyond itself. How could the lives of these nobles be the same after going through such a profound, life-altering event?

In fact, the midrash's sharp eye and penetrating insight leads it to quite the opposite conclusion: far from being an isolated incident on top of a mountain, Bnai Yisrael's top brass having a rendezvous with the Divine and miraculously living to tell the tale sheds many rays of light, and uncover many layers of depth, on some of the most puzzling narratives in the entire Torah. The midrash even identifies for us the central key to unlocking the mystery of Shmot 24, the key which binds all the nobles of Bnai Yisrael together: they ended up dying for either ambiguous or unknown reasons. Recall that the nobles told to ascend to Hashem were: Moshe and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy elders of Yisrael. Nadav and Avihu were punished for offering a foreign fire which was not commanded, though why they had to die because of this infraction is not made clear:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Nadav and Avihu, the sons of Aharon, each took his fire pan, and put fire and incense on it. They brought before Hashem a foreign fire which He did not command them. A fire went out from before Hashem and consumed them, and they died before Hashem. Moshe said to Aharon, this is as Hashem spoke, saying: 'I will be sanctified through those that are close to Me, and I will be honored before all the nation.' And Aharon was silent."**^[137]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The above-mentioned seventy elders do not make another appearance, at least not explicitly. However, another group of seventy elders is appointed by Moshe to help him handle the demands of shepherding G-d's unruly and stubborn nation:

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The nation was complaining bitterly, and it was wicked in the ears of Hashem; Hashem heard and was incensed. A fire of Hashem burnt them, and consumed the edge of the camp. The nation cried out to Moshe, and Moshe prayed to Hashem, and the fire subsided. That place was then named Tav'eira, for a fire of Hashem had burnt there. And the riffraff in the nation's midst had a great desire, and they sat and cried along with Bnai Yisrael, and they said, who will feed us meat ...

Moshe heard the nation crying to their families, each man in the entrance of his tent; Hashem was incensed, and it was wicked in Moshe's eyes. Moshe said to Hashem, why have you dealt wickedly with your servant, and why have I not found favor in your eyes, that you have placed the burden of this nation upon me ...

Hashem said to Moshe, gather for me seventy people from the elders of Yisrael who you know, for they are the elders of the nation and its officers. You shall take them to the Ohel Moed and they shall take their places there with you. And I will descend and speak with you there, and I will draw from the spirit which is upon you and place it on them. They shall bear the burden of the nation with you, so you won't have to bear it alone ...

Moshe went out and told the nation the words of Hashem. He gathered seventy elders from the nation, and stood them around the tent. Hashem came down in a cloud and spoke to him, and He drew from the spirit that was upon Moshe and gave it to the seventy elders. Once the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and did not cease ... Moshe and the elders of Yisrael gathered back into the camp."**^[138]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Implied in the command to gather and appoint seventy elders is the disappearance of seventy elders described as being in a similar position of authority just over a year earlier. While it is possible to argue that HaKadosh Baruch Hu commanded Moshe to appoint seventy elders even though another group of seventy elders - the group present at Har Sinai - was still active in national leadership, this is difficult to maintain: if that were indeed the case, why was Moshe so distraught at having to carry the burden of leadership by himself? And why would HaKadosh Baruch Hu not simply have Moshe delegate some responsibility to the existing elders? A more plausible explanation seems to be that the elders who saw the G-d of Yisrael at Har Sinai had disappeared, yet why would that be the case?

Furthermore, arguably the most famous example of a death sentence in the Torah whose punishment does not seem to fit the crime would be that of Moshe and Aharon:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיִּקַּ֥ח מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת הַמַּטֶּ֖ה מִלִּפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּֽהוּ׃ וַיַּקְהִ֜לוּ מֹשֶׁ֧ה וְאַהֲרֹ֛ן אֶת הַקָּהָ֖ל אֶל פְּנֵ֣י הַסָּ֑לַע וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לָהֶ֗ם שִׁמְעוּ נָא֙ הַמֹּרִ֔ים הֲמִן הַסֶּ֣לַע הַזֶּ֔ה נוֹצִ֥יא לָכֶ֖ם מָֽיִם׃ וַיָּ֨רֶם מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶת יָד֗וֹ וַיַּ֧ךְ אֶת הַסֶּ֛לַע בְּמַטֵּ֖הוּ פַּעֲמָ֑יִם וַיֵּצְאוּ֙ מַ֣יִם רַבִּ֔ים וַתֵּ֥שְׁתְּ הָעֵדָ֖ה וּבְעִירָֽם׃ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָה֮ אֶל מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאֶֽל אַהֲרֹן֒ יַ֚עַן לֹא הֶאֱמַנְתֶּ֣ם בִּ֔י לְהַ֨קְדִּישֵׁ֔נִי לְעֵינֵ֖י בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל לָכֵ֗ן לֹ֤א תָבִ֙יאוּ֙ אֶת הַקָּהָ֣ל הַזֶּ֔ה אֶל הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁר נָתַ֥תִּי לָהֶֽם׃ הֵ֚מָּה מֵ֣י מְרִיבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר רָב֥וּ בְנֵֽי יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת יְהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּקָּדֵ֖שׁ בָּֽם׃**^[139]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Moshe took the staff from before Hashem as he had been commanded. Moshe and Aharon gathered the assembly before the rock and Moshe said to them, listen here you rebels: shall we get water for you out of this rock? Moshe raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff. Copious amounts of water came out, and the assembly and their beasts drank from it. Hashem said to Moshe and Aharon, because you did not believe in Me to sanctify me in the eyes of Bnai Yisrael; therefore, you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given to them. Those are the waters of strife - in that Bnai Yisrael strove with Hashem - and He was sanctified through them."**^[139]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Comparing the three cases yields that each group's death was unique in several respects. The deaths of Nadav and Avihu were instantaneous, occurring immediately after the act which condemned them to their fate. In contrast, we have no idea when the deaths of the original seventy elders occurred, though we can logically infer they died within a year of Ma'amad Har Sinai.**^[140]{.underline}^** And while the deaths of Moshe and Aharon were delayed - as fire did not descend from the heavens and consume them right after their sin - their deaths did come earlier than expected had they been permitted to lead Bnai Yisrael into Eretz Canaan; their final breaths occurred within a year of HaKadosh Baruch Hu's fatal decree.**^[141]{.underline}^**

Nevertheless, the intriguing and perplexing nature of each groups' death may be more than just a coincidence, given that they all shared a strange yet unifying experience. To understand how the midrash weaves together a theory on how all these incidents are interrelated, it first behooves us to critically break down each episode independently within its own context, and delineate the relevant linguistic and thematic questions which surround the glaring quandaries which piqued the Rabbis' interest, such as:

- [Nadav and Avihu]{.underline} What drove Aharon's two eldest sons to bring their incense pans, and what was so terrible about their offering that it warranted such a sensational punishment? What did Moshe mean when he said Hashem will be sanctified through it, and why was Aharon silent?

- [Seventy Elders]{.underline} What exactly happened to the first group of elders that a new group needed appointing? And does it relate somehow to the narratives of bitter complainers and the riffraff which precede the new groups' designation and appointment?

- [Moshe and Aharon]{.underline} When exactly did the incident at Mei Merivah take place? And what explains Hashem's response to Moshe's actions, given that this story is nearly identical to the story of Masa U'Merivah which happened just after Bnai Yisrael left Egypt?**^[142]{.underline}^**

Looking closely at the linguistic and thematic anomalies in each of these stories, and using them as a springboard for exegetical midrashic analysis, will set the stage for a deeper and more profound understanding of these stories. Seeing as the first of these groups to perish is Nadav and Avihu, it is to that disturbing episode which we will turn our attention to.



**Part 1: Two Instead of Four**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

In discussing the procedure the Sanhedrin is instructed to follow when administering capital punishment, the Talmud records an argument over where these laws are derived from:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רבי אלעזר אמר אתיא שריפה שריפה מבני אהרן מה להלן שריפת נשמה וגוף קיים אף כאן שריפת נשמה וגוף קיים ... ומאן דיליף מבני אהרן מנא ליה דכתי' (ויקרא י, ב) וימותו לפני ה' כעין מיתה. ואידך ההוא שריפה ממש הואי ומאי דכתיב וימותו דאתחיל בהו מגואי כעין מיתה דתניא אבא יוסי בן דוסתאי אומר שני חוטין של אש יצאו מבית קודש הקדשים ונחלקו לארבע ונכנסו שנים בחוטמו של זה ושנים בחוטמו של זה ושרפום והכתיב (ויקרא י, ב) ותאכל אותם אותם ולא בגדיהם׃**^[142b]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Elazar said, we derive the burning process of the Sanhedrin for capital cases from the burning of the sons of Aharon: just as there it was a burning of the soul but the body remained intact, so too here we should burn the soul but the body should remain intact ... where does this opinion relating to the sons of Aharon derive this from? It says: 'They died before Hashem' (Vayikra 10:2), like a natural death in that the body remains intact. But according to the other opinion which says that their bodies were burned, why does it say they died in a natural way? It means that the flame started inside them, similar to how natural death is within a person. As it was taught: Abba Yosi Ben Dostai says, two streams of fire went out from the Kodesh HaKodashim and split into four: two went into the nostrils of this one and two went into the nostrils of this one, and burned them both. Yet does it not say: 'It consumed them' (Vayikra 10:2)? Yes, but that can be understood to mean them, but not their clothes."**^[143]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

What exactly happened when Nadav and Avihu were consumed by fire? According to the Tanna Kamma they were burnt alive by the flame; though their bodies were completely charred, their clothes remained miraculously undamaged. Rabbi Elazar disagrees, contending that it was their souls which were burnt by the fire while their bodies remained unscorched. What lies behind this disagreement - are these Rabbis arguing about what actually happened, or is the debate about something more fundamental, perhaps a clash of worldviews, with the story of Nadav and Avihu acting as a pedagogical tool to flesh out the conflict?

**[Above and Below]{.underline}**

Among the exegetical techniques employed by midrash to gain insight into a puzzling word or description is to look at the first time that word or description appears in Tanach and use it as a paradigm from which to derive and extrapolate information on later occurrences. A beautiful example of this technique can be found in a discussion surrounding the description of Moshe as being good in the eyes of his mother:

"'She saw that he was good' (Shmot 2:2). It was taught: Rabbi Meir says, his name was Tov good. Rabbi Yehudah says, his name was Toviah. Rabbi Nehemiah says, he was worthy of prophecy. Others say, he was born circumcised. And the Rabbis say, when Moshe was born the entire house was filled with light. It says here: 'She saw that he was good', and it says there: 'G-d saw that the light was good' (Breishit 1:4)."**^[144]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

What does it mean that Yocheved saw her three month old son was good - don't all mothers have a protective maternal instinct over their babies, and would be willing to do anything to help them? Surely the description of Moshe being good is meant to teach something more than how his mother viewed him, and as it is the first descriptive term ever used to describe Moshe, it is interpreted as a tool to describe his character. The Rabbis employ this rule of paradigms**^[145]{.underline}^** and look to the first time 'good' is found in the Torah, and discover it is in the context of Creation: G-d saw that the light was good. The Rabbis are then able to connect the concept of light with Moshe's birth, which in turn lays the foundation for highlighting Moshe's messianic role in the deliverance of G-d's people and the fulfillment of Hashem's promise to Avraham. Great men such as Moshe, argues the midrash, are chosen from birth by G-d, and Moshe was born set apart for a unique mission, brought into the world to receive the Torah and bring Bnai Yisrael to the Promised Land.**^[146]{.underline}^**

In a similar vein, to understand the nature of the supernatural flame which consumed Nadav and Avihu, it behooves us to analyze the first occurrence of a supernatural flame in the Torah:**^[147]{.underline}^**

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַ֠יֵּרָ֠א מַלְאַ֨ךְ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֵלָ֛יו בְּלַבַּת אֵ֖שׁ מִתּ֣וֹךְ הַסְּנֶ֑ה וַיַּ֗רְא וְהִנֵּ֤ה הַסְּנֶה֙ בֹּעֵ֣ר בָּאֵ֔שׁ וְהַסְּנֶ֖ה אֵינֶ֥נּוּ אֻכָּֽל׃ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֔ה אָסֻֽרָה נָּ֣א וְאֶרְאֶ֔ה אֶת הַמַּרְאֶ֥ה הַגָּדֹ֖ל הַזֶּ֑ה מַדּ֖וּעַ לֹא יִבְעַ֥ר הַסְּנֶֽה׃**^[148]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"An angel of Hashem appeared to Moshe in a blazing fire from within the bush. He saw and behold, the bush was aflame, yet the bush was not consumed. Moshe said, I must turn aside and see this wonderful sight: why doesn't the bush burn up?"**^[148]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Moshe is so shocked by the unusual behavior of this flame that he feels compelled to investigate further. What sets this Heavenly flame apart from regular, earthly flames? The Torah reveals the answer: the Divine flame burns, but does not consume.**^[149]{.underline}^** It should follow that the fire which destroyed Nadav and Avihu also burned but did not consume, yet there is a problem with this assertion: the Torah explicitly describes the fire of Nadav and Avihu as *"consuming them, and they died before Hashem".* Perhaps despite their destruction involving consumption, it must have also involved non-consumption, for as we have seen flames from above are set apart in that they burn, but do not consume.

The opinions of Rabbi Elazar and Abba Yosi Ben Dostai support this very contention.**^[150]{.underline}^** According to Abba Yosi Ben Dostai the bodies of Nadav and Avihu were burned by the fire but their clothes were left intact, similar to how the bush burned on the inside but was not consumed externally. Rabbi Elazar contends that Nadav and Avihus' physical bodies were spared and survived the encounter; it was their souls, not their bodies and not their clothes, that were burnt. It follows that the unique nature of Divine fire from above burning the inner layer but not consuming the outer layer is maintained by both Rabbis, and their argument becomes transformed into a debate surrounding the details of that consumption.**^[151]{.underline}^**

This connection to the burning bush, while providing a compelling thematic motivation for this midrashic exercise, does not tell the whole story. It does not explain why the Rabbi Elazar and Abba Yosi Ben Dostai disagree about the non-consumption, even while they both link the deaths of Aharon's son to the miracle at the burning bush. Does anything more substantive lie beneath Rabbi Elazar's contention that their souls were destroyed by the fire, as compared to Abba Yosi Ben Dostai's insistence on the scorching of their physical bodies?

**[Skin and Bones]{.underline}**

A closer look at what unfolds immediately after Nadav and Avihus' inferno brings with it additional complexity. The Torah informs us that Moshe instructed kinsmen Mishael and Eltzafan to remove Nadav and Avihu from inside the Mishkan and take them outside of the camp.**^[152]{.underline}^** This is all well and good for Rabbi Elazar, who held that while their souls were charred, their bodies remained intact, but according to Abba Yosi Ben Dostai who argued that their bodies were incinerated, what exactly did Mishael and Eltzafan carry out of the camp?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
בת"כ איכא ב' ברייתות שנויות סתם דפליגי מעיקרא קתני כיצד היתה מיתתן שני חוטין כו' ונשרף גופן ובגדיהן קיימין שנאמר ותצא אש מלפני ה' ותאכל אותם וימותו (ויקרא י, ב) ובתר הכי גבי יבכו את השריפה (ויקרא י, ו) קתני שריפת נשמה וגוף קיים.

וא"ת והא אמרי' בפ' הישן (סוכה דף כה: ושם) מישאל ואלצפן היו שנדחו לפסח שני ואי שריפה ממש הואי לא נטמאו ויש לומר דשלדן קיימת הוה כדאמר בהמפלת (נדה דף כז:) מת שנשרף ושלדו קיימת טמא:**^[153]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"It is brought in Torat Kohanim i.e. Sifra in two separate teachings which are recorded anonymously. The first one teaches: how did they die? Two streams went out and burned their bodies, but their clothes remained intact in accordance with Rabbi Elazar, as it says: 'A fire went out from before Hashem and consumed them and they died' (Vayikra 10:1). Yet the second one teaches: after that in regards to: 'They shall weep over the incineration' (Vayikra 10:6) - this means their souls were incinerated, but their bodies remained intact.

And if you will ask, does it not say in Sukkot 25b that Mishael and Eltzafan were the ones who were pushed off to Pesach Sheni because they had been made impure while tending to Nadav and Avihus' bodies? If their bodies were incinerated, how could Mishael and Eltzafan have become impure? We could say that even if their bodies were charred their skeleton survived, and it says in Niddah 27b that a dead person who is incinerated but his skeleton survives conveys impurity."**^[153]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Tosafot notes that the debate between Rabbi Elazar and Abba Yosi Ben Dostai is also found in the Sifra between two competing anonymous teachings. He then asks: according to the opinion proffered by Abba Yosi Ben Dostai that their bodies were incinerated, how could Mishael and Eltzafan have become impure from carrying them? The solution suggested by Tosafot is quite gruesome: indeed, nothing was left of Nadav and Avihu for their kinsmen to take outside of the camp except their skeletons; the rest of their bodies were burnt out of existence. The good news, however, is that even skeletons of the dead carry impurity, so Abba Yosi Ben Dostai is not in conflict with the midrash that identifies the men who were unable to celebrate Pesach in the desert with Mishael and Eltzafan.**^[154]{.underline}^** We can also employ Tosafot's explanation to answer the question posed earlier: for Abba Yosi Ben Dostai, even though no bodies remained, Mishael and Eltzafan were able to carry Nadav and Avihus' charred skeletons out of the Mishkan.

Mishael and Eltzafan also figure prominently in a related aggadic discussion involving Rabbis Eliezer and Akiva concerning Nadav and Avihus' deaths:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
״וימותו לפני ה׳״. רבי אליעזר אומר, לא מתו אלא בחוץ, מקום שהלוים מותרים לכנס לשם שנאמר: ״ויקרבו וישאום בכתנתם״. אם כן למה נאמר: ״וימותו לפני ה׳״? נגפן מלאך ודחפן לחוץ והוציאן. רבי עקיבא אומר, לא מתו אלא בפנים שנאמר: ״וימותו לפני ה׳״. אם כן למה נאמר: ״ויקרבו וישאום בכתנתם״? מלמד שהטילו חנית של ברזל וגררום והוציאום לחוץ:**^[155]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'They died before Hashem' (Vayikra 10:2). Rabbi Eliezer says, they died outside of the Kodesh Kodashim, in a place where Leviim were allowed to enter, as it says: 'They i.e. the Leviim approached and carried them by their tunics' (Vayikra 10:5). If so, why does it say 'They died before Hashem'? An angel struck them and pushed them outside, and removed them. Rabbi Akiva says, they died inside of the Kodesh Kodashim, as it says: 'They died before Hashem'. If so, why does it say 'They approached and carried them by their tunics'? The Leviim took a spear of iron and dragged Nadav and Avihu and brought them out of the Kodesh Kodashim."**^[155]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is a difficulty inherent in how events are said to have unfolded. Nadav and Avihu must have been in the innermost sanctum of the Mishkan where only Kohanim were permitted, as they are described as having been removed *"from before the Kodesh"***^[152]{.underline}^**. Yet only Kohanim were allowed to enter there, so how could Mishael and Eltzafan, who after all were Leviim and not Kohanim, be commanded to take them outside of the camp?

Rabbi Eliezer resolves the issue by maintaining the fire occurred outside, but an angel**^[156]{.underline}^** ejected them from the Kodesh HaKodashim as they were being consumed by fire; their bodies landed in a place where Leviim were permitted to reach them. Rabbi Akiva, in contrast, argues they never left the innermost area of holiness, for we know they died *"before Hashem"*. Rather, the Leviim must have managed to remove them - their bodies according to Rabbi Elazar, their skeletons according to Abba Yosi Ben Dostai - by prodding them with a sharp metal spear while they remained in a permissible area for Leviim.

While either opinion in the debate on how Nadav and Avihu were punished can work with either opinion in the debate on where they died, there does seem to be an intuitive alliance between Abba Yosi Ben Dostai and Rabbi Eliezer on one side, and Rabbis Elazar and Akiva on the other.

Fundamentally, Abba Yosi Ben Dostai is focused on the physical aspect of their deaths: their bodies were destroyed and their clothes were spared, yet no mention is made of their souls. In contrast, Rabbi Elazar is more concerned with the Divine flame snuffing out their spiritual, rather than their physical, existence. In a similar vein, the debate between Rabbis Eliezer and Akiva can be framed as a question on primacy between the physical and spiritual repercussions of Nadav and Avihus' sin. Rabbi Eliezer depicts them as being forcefully expelled from G-d's holiest chamber by a powerful, spiritual force; the miraculous nature of the incident is amplified and magnified to new heights, adding an angelic being with incredible strength to a supernatural fire from above. Rabbi Akiva paints a picture that is more naturalistic, more subdued; when Nadav and Avihu were killed they simply remained in the same spot, same as any normal death. Rabbi Akiva's depiction of Mishael and Eltzafan stabbing their corpses - or skeletons - with spears and dragging them out of the Kodesh HaKodashim is viscerally physical and down-to-earth, contrasting profoundly with the lofty imagery employed by Rabbi Eliezer.**^[157]{.underline}^**

This dichotomy between the spiritual and physical nature of Nadav and Avihus' punishments is largely a reflection of the ambiguity surrounding what Nadav and Avihu actually did wrong in the first place. The fundamental question therefore becomes: was their sin primarily physical, or spiritual? If their sin was physical, it would follow that their punishment should emphasize physicality as well: charred bodies that had to be stabbed with spears and dragged across the floor. On the other hand, if their sin was spiritual in nature they would be punished in kind: souls snuffed out of existence, exiled from holiness by an angel of fire.**^[158]{.underline}^**

**[Tragic Scapegoats]{.underline}**

There is no shortage of midrashic responses to the question of the nature of Nadav and Avihus' offense. The simplest approach would be to take the Torah at face value and attribute their sin to them bringing an offering of their own volition.**^[159]{.underline}^** Yet this explanation merely suffers from the same challenge as the account it faithfully tries to defend: what exactly was so terrible as to deserve such an unnatural death?

Another tradition goes to the other extreme and suggests completely unrelated possibilities for Nadav and Avihus' sin, while simultaneously ignoring the foreign fire:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"Rabbi Manai from Sheav and Rabbi Yehoshua from Sichnin and Rabbi Yochanan in the name of Rabbi Levi said, the sons of Aharon died because of four things, and regarding each of them the Torah prescribes death. (1) They were drunk on wine, and it prescribes death, as it says: 'You shall not drink wine and beer during sacrificial service' (Vayikra 10:9). (2) They were missing priestly garments, and it prescribes death, as it says: 'They shall be on Aharon and his sons' (Shmot 28:43). Which garments were missing? The Me'il, and it prescribes death, as it says: 'It shall be on Aharon to serve' (Shmot 28:35). (3) They went in without washing their hands and feet first, as it says: 'They shall wash their hands and feet and not die' (Shmot 30:21), and it says: 'When they come to the Ohel Moed they shall wash with water' (Shmot 30:20). (4) They did not have sons, and it prescribes death, as it says: 'Nadav and Avihu died' (Bemidbar 3:4). Abba Hanin says, because they did not have wives, as it says: 'He shall atone for himself and his house' (Vayikra 16:6) - his house means his wife."**^[160]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

All these sins, along with many others detailed in the midrashim**^[161]{.underline}^**, are essentially actions that Nadav and Avihu could have prevented directly by conducting themselves in a different way. Even the fourth possibility, namely that they didn't have children, is still considered a fault to them for choosing not to fulfill the mitzvah of procreation.**^[162]{.underline}^** HaKadosh Baruch Hu conducts Himself in a way that is just and fair; surely if Nadav and Avihu were punished in such a spectacular way, it must have been as a direct result of their having committed some personal, avoidable transgression. These midrashim are motivated at least in part by a desire to emphasize this central theological principle, defending the appropriateness of HaKadosh Baruch Hu's actions and seeing in them a justification for the belief that He operates in the world *middah keneged middah*, measure for measure.

There is another, later tradition which radically subverts this commonly asserted aggadic belief. If one claims that Nadav and Avihus' death was not due to their having committed a sin, the ambiguity of the pesukim on what they did wrong becomes somewhat less problematic. Yet if they were innocent, or at least not guilty of a sin serious enough to warrant the death penalty, there is an obvious question to ask: why did HaKadosh Baruch Hu kill them?

"How do we know that prayer nullifies half of a decree? You find in regards to Aharon, as it says: 'And Hashem was angry enough with Aharon to destroy him' (Devarim 9:20). Rabbi Yehoshua from Sichnin said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi, the language of destroying is only in regards to the uprooting of male and female children, as it says: 'I will destroy his fruits from above and his roots from below' (Amos 2:9). HaKadosh Baruch Hu did not do so i.e. did not destroy Aharon because Moshe prayed on his behalf, as it says: 'I also prayed for Aharon at that time' (Devarim 9:20). HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to him, since you prayed for him, you have nullified half of the decree. 'To Elazar and Itamar the remaining sons' (Vayikra 10:12) - this teaches that they had also been included in the original decree. Rabbi Mana from Sheav said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi: 'If you refrained from those taken off to die' (Mishlei 24:11) - you find that because of Moshe's prayer, Elazar and Itamar were saved. HaKadosh Baruch Hu said, by your life the decree was that all four boys should die, but since Moshe prayed I have nullified half of the decree, and nullified it for two sons and left it for two sons. This is as it says: 'After the death of Aharon's two sons.'"**^[163]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Nadav and Avihu were killed as an act of collective punishment: their deaths provided an atonement for their father Aharon's active participation in the sin of the golden calf. Hashem wanted to destroy Aharon as a response to his behavior of condoning and supporting *avodah zarah*, and He would have done so had Moshe not interceded on Aharon's behalf and prayed that his brother's life be spared. Pesikta Rabbati argues that prayer nullifies half a decree, but not an entire decree: instead of destroying Aharon, taken to mean the death of all his children, Hashem spared half of them, namely Elazar and Itamar; Nadav and Avihu were condemned to die for Aharon's actions through no fault of their own.

This explanation seems to run counter to key dogmas of Rabbnic theology and is quite disturbing at first glance, but upon closer inspection it stylistically ties together many loose strands and open questions in a cohesive way. For example, after Nadav and Avihu were consumed, the Torah famously and cryptically informs us that their father Aharon was silent. What does his silence mean? There are three major suggestions offered in the aggadic tradition which can all be found echoed in the classical commentaries on Chumash:

- **Shock -** Mourners "have no mouth" on the day of a loved one's death, as the pain and trauma of loss renders them speechless. In recognition of this very human response to tragedy, a halachic custom developed to serve lentils at a house of mourning.**^[164]{.underline}^**

- **Acceptance -** Silence on the part of the mourner indicates a reconciliation of G-d's justice even in times when such justice is difficult to see, intellectually or emotionally. Such silence is praiseworthy and leads to great reward.**^[165]{.underline}^**

- **Comfort -** If a mourner knows his loved one lived a good life, full of proper deeds and righteousness, perhaps he can take comfort in a death that can be eulogized as an example of a life well lived.**^[166]{.underline}^**

While the last two ideas are similar in some sense, there is a difference between them. Acceptance is *tzidduk hadin*, internalizing that there was a reason why your loved one had to die, while comfort is seeing in your loved one's death something positive. Acceptance may therefore still be plausible if the loved one who died deserved it on account of sinful behavior, while comfort makes more sense as a reason for silence when the deceased was someone righteous. The first answer, of course, can apply in all cases, regardless of how good or evil the loved one happened to be.

Given the above, we can understand how the approach of Aharon's silence stemming from raw, emotional shock makes sense if Nadav and Avihu died on account of their own sins: his silence conveys intense grief at his sons' death mingled with horror at the knowledge and realization that his sons had acted so unacceptably. Similarly, a willing acceptance of Divine authority and justice aligns with the tradition that attributes various sinful acts to Nadav and Avihu: they died because they committed one or multiple sins, and Aharon's silence was then an acceptance that actions have consequences and his sons deserved to die. Yet how can we accept the third opinion presented above, espoused in Midrash Tanchuma HaYashan and other places, that Moshe comforted Aharon through his effusive praise of Nadav and Avihu, given all the midrashim that fault Nadav and Avihu for their deaths?

The answer lies in removing the burden of sin - or at least sin worthy of such extreme punishment - from Nadav and Avihu. Why was Aharon silent once informed by Moshe that his sons' deaths were in order to glorify G-d's name? This question falls away if we turn to Pesikta Rabbati's explanation of the incident, which instead turns the relatively straightforward interpretation of silencing being a manifestation of acceptance or comfort on its head.

Silence signaling Aharon's *tzidduk hadin* is a plausible explanation, but not because Aharon made peace with the deaths of his sons. Quite the opposite: Aharon made peace with the fact that his own actions would not go unpunished, that his acquiescence to assist in the building of the golden calf should have led to his own death, as Moshe himself testifies to in Devarim 9:9. Aharon's silence is an acceptance that his sons' deaths are in lieu of his own, and as difficult and unbearable as that knowledge is, he accepts it silently. The explanation of comfort is also understandable; Aharon was comforted by the survival of his two remaining sons, and the efficacy of Moshe's prayer. Yet there is another, selfish dimension to Aharon's comfort as well: Aharon was not silent because he was comforted his sons' deaths were a response to their righteousness; he was comforted because, as Moshe himself had assumed, their deaths meant that he was now safe from Divine fury, that his being worthy of punishment was no longer hanging over him. While the death of his two eldest sons must have caused him immeasurable pain, it is also understandable that in parallel he felt some level of relief knowing that his ledger was no longer blood red, that the slate of his past had been wiped clean in the Heavenly court.

When all the dust settles, removing the guilty behavior from Nadav and Avihu and instead placing it squarely at the feet of Aharon allows for every interpretation of Aharon's silence, albeit for different reasons than those given in most mainstream midrashim. Aharon's silence stemming from raw shock makes sense if Nadav and Avihu died on account of their own sins: grief at his sons' passing combined with abject disgust at the realization that it was on his account, the fault of his sins. It also works as a manifestation of Aharon's acceptance of G-d's actions, of his sons' deaths being the will of the Creator as a result of his behavior; one could go so far as to suggest that we would not be surprised if a father would gladly sacrifice his own life for those of his children, and the *tzidduk hadin* present here is Aharon wishing beyond anything to die in his sons' stead, yet accepting that HaKadosh Baruch Hu inscrutably wanted him to live and his sons to die in his stead. And thirdly, we can understand how Aharon's silence indicates comfort, a twisted, psychologically complex sense of relief that, despite the unspeakable tragedy of his sons' death, he was now off the hook.**^[167]{.underline}^**

**[At the Border]{.underline}**

This tradition found in Pesikta Rabbati also illuminates and interplays with other midrashim commenting on another perplexing story revolving around Aharon, incense and death:

Moshe said to Aharon, take the pan and put fire from the altar on it and place incense, and go quickly to the assembly and atone for them, for the anger has gone out from before Hashem; the plague has begun. Aharon took as Moshe commanded, and he ran into the congregation and saw that indeed the plague had begun in the nation. He placed the incense and atoned for the nation. He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped. 14,700 had died from the plague, not counting those who had died on account of Korach. Aharon returned to Moshe to the entrance of the Ohel Moed, and the plague stopped."**^[168]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

In the aftermath of Korach's failed rebellion, the nation is defiant and mutinous. The people accuse Moshe and Aharon of having a direct hand in the deaths of Hashem's nation. This garnered an angry response from Hashem, who perhaps - as it were - had hoped the silencing of Korach and his followers would similarly cow the people into submission. For some inexplicable reason, in contrast to all previous instances where Hashem threatened to wipe out Bnai Yisrael, Moshe does not stand up and supplicate on the nation's behalf; he somehow intuits that there is no hope in preventing the oncoming destruction, instead adopting a strategy of minimizing the damage. Why Moshe's response in this episode should be set apart in this way is not immediately obvious from the pesukim. 

Several other questions also present themselves from even a cursory reading of this story:

- How did Moshe know what needed to be done in order to stop the plague?**^[169]{.underline}^**

- Why was incense specifically the magic antidote needed to stop the plague?**^[170]{.underline}^**

- HaKadosh Baruch Hu had expressed a clear desire to destroy Bnai Yisrael. He was the one who controlled the plague's initial spread and eventual containment. What was it about Aharon carrying the incense that could have compelled Him to end the plague?

- Why did Moshe ask Aharon to go stop the plague instead of dealing with it himself?

- Aharon's acquiescence to Moshe's request, despite the clear mortal danger, implies he implicitly knew it was his task to complete. Why didn't Aharon object?

The answer to all of these questions lies in understanding the deeper relationship between the sin of Nadav and Avihu and that of the nation in response to Korach's rebellion:

"'Take Aharon and his sons' (Vayikra 8:2) ... why does it say 'take' here? HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe, I require taking - you stand up and make Aharon great through taking, as it says: 'Take Aharon'. And when did Aharon take? When the anger went out from before Hashem to destroy the enemies of Yisrael. When Moshe saw, he said to Aharon, why are you standing here? 'Take the pan and put fire on it' (Bemidbar 17:11). Aharon said to him, my teacher Moshe, are you trying to have me killed? My sons were burned because they brought a non-consecrated fire before Him, as it says: 'They brought before Hashem a foreign fire ... a fire went out from before Hashem and consumed them' (Vayikra 10:1-2); and now you tell me to 'take the pan'? My sons brought a non-holy fire inside and were burned, and I should take a holy fire outside - will I not be killed and burned as well? Moshe said to him, go do quickly what you heard; as you stand and wax on, people are dying. Do it quickly, as it says: 'Go quickly to the assembly and atone for them; for the anger has gone out from before Hashem, the plague has begun (Bemidbar 17:11). When Aharon heard this he said, if I die on account of Yisrael, even for that I am not worthy. Immediately: 'Aharon took as Moshe commanded' (Bemidbar 17:12). Therefore HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe, take Aharon, make him great through taking. Just as Aharon saved My children through taking, as it says: 'Take the pan' (Bemidbar 17:11), so too you should make him great through taking, as it says: 'Take Aharon.'"**^[171]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Tanchuma Yelamdenu inserts into Aharon's reaction to Moshe's command the proverbial elephant in the room. Aharon's two sons had died precisely because of this exact sin: bringing fire and incense in an improper way that had not been commanded. Why now should Aharon think that his doing something nearly identical would not lead to his death? *Kal vachomer,* his death should be expected, for unlike his sons he had the opportunity to learn the fatal consequences from their fate. Moshe does not assuage Aharon's concerns, but doubles down. Action is not merely preferable to inaction; it is necessary, no matter the cost. We must act, even if it is a suicide mission, for inaction in the face of such a crisis would be inexcusable.

Another midrashic tradition has Moshe arguing that Aharon should specifically and intentionally act similarly to Nadav and Avihu in order to teach the people an important lesson:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
מיד כל אחד ואחד מן המלאכים למד לו דבר, ואף מלאך המות למדו מעשה הקטורת, כשיצא הקצף שיקח את המחתה, ויתן עליה מאותו הקטורת כדי שימנע הקצף, וכשיצא הקצף והחל הנגף בעם, מיד אמר משה אל אהרן קח את המחתה ותן עליה קטרת. מפני מה נמנע הקצף, אלא אמר הקב"ה הם מרננים על הקטורת כי הוא המית נדב ואביהוא, לכך אמר הקב"ה למשה אמור אל אהרן שיקטיר על העם (להודיעך) להודיעם כי הקטורת אינו ממית, אלא העון הוא הממית, לפיכך זכה הקטורת וכפר על העם:**^[172]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Immediately each one of the angels came and taught Moshe something, and even the Angel of Death taught him about the secret of the incense, namely that when the angel would go out he should take the pan and place on it from that very incense in order to prevent the anger. When the anger went out and the plague began among the nation, Moshe immediately said to Aharon: 'Take the pan and place incense on it'. Why did that stop the anger? HaKadosh Baruch Hu said, they are badmouthing the incense because it killed Nadav and Avihu; therefore, HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe, say to Aharon that he should offer incense on the nation's behalf, in order to inform them that it is not the incense that kills but rather the sin that kills. The incense therefore merited to atone for the nation."**^[172]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This teaching boldly asserts that HaKadosh Baruch Hu told Moshe how to stop the plague, which certainly seems to clash with these pesukim's emotionally destructive weight. It seems odd to interpret HaKadosh Baruch Hu bent on destroying the people while simultaneously teaching Moshe and Aharon how to save the people in order to convey a lesson about the illusion of incense. And yet, having to accept this difficulty is outweighed in the eyes of the midrash by an important thematic closure gained from such an explanation: because Moshe knew about the secret of the incense from the Angel of Death, and because he was specifically commanded to use it, any contradiction from Nadav and Avihu being killed for also offering incense that had "not been commanded" disappears. It also allows the midrash to impart an important hashkafic lesson as well, one whose message is somewhat subversive: This episode could have one mistakenly believe that incense, and by extension other supplications, do have the power to force G-d Himself to act in a certain way. Such a belief would not be unheard of, as certain pagan belief systems felt that gods were coerced to automatically and by necessity respond to offerings or rituals performed in a certain way. To dissuade us of such a heretical view of HaKadosh Baruch Hu, the midrash emphasizes explicitly this core Rabbinic belief: G-d cares less about the motions than about the intention behind them.**^[173]{.underline}^** A hashkafic lesson on Divine providence is contained within this teaching as well: even as G-d administers punishment to His nation, He still cares for them and protects them, ensuring that the punishment is contained.**^[174]{.underline}^**

Yet another approach which addresses Aharon's silence here acknowledges that some dialogue is missing from the text: Aharon did voice his concerns, to which Moshe responded by reassuring him that there is an important difference between his situation and that of his sons. While outwardly the two actions - bringing incense which was not explicitly sanctioned - may be comparable, the intentions behind them are diametric opposites. Nadav and Avihu acted with arrogance, for themselves**^[175]{.underline}^**; their deed was inherently sinful due to its selfish nature. Aharon, however, would be acting selflessly, putting his life in jeopardy to rescue Bnai Yisrael from certain death; this, argued Moshe, makes all the difference.**^[176]{.underline}^**

All the answers proposed by the midrash so far do provide some level of collective comfort, but they still fail to satisfactorily explain why Aharon - and not Moshe - had to stop the plague. If the reason for hope was the brothers' laudable motivation to protect Bnai Yisrael, surely Moshe himself could also have carried the incense pan. Alternatively, if Aharon's designation was to teach the people that it is sin, not incense, which kills, here too the act of redemption via incense could have been accomplished regardless of the identity of its carrier. So the question remains: was Aharon's selection arbitrary, or deliberate?**^[177]{.underline}^**

Enter Pesikta Rabbati, which posits that all four of Aharon's sons were destined to die after the golden calf catastrophe had it not been for Moshe's intercession on their behalf. Nadav and Avihu died due to Aharon's sin in a way that was somehow entangled with their bringing incense, while Elazar and Itamar survived despite Aharon's sin and were not affected in any way. And yet, all four of Aharon's sons were supposed to die instead of him - after all, to really fulfill Aharon's destruction through his children, all of them would need to perish as if even one survives he can continue Aharon's name. Moshe, however, had prayed on Aharon's behalf so that only two sons died, not all four. In effect, then, Moshe *"stood between the dead and the living"* when he supplicated G-d on behalf of Aharon: his prayers led to a separation between the dead sons of Aharon - Nadav and Avihu - and the live sons of Aharon - Elazar and Itamar.

Aharon, with the deaths of his sons seared into his memory, therefore identified with the concept of standing *"between the dead and the living"* in a visceral way, had a tragically personal familiarity with the fine line between death and survival. He was saved as a result of Moshe's prayers, but did not escape unscathed. It is this Moshe is instructing Aharon on: Aharon, whose very life and the lives of his two children had been spared because of another's intercession, needed closure. Aharon, enabler of nationwide idol worship, was to blame for the first plague to sweep through and claim the lives of Bnai Yisrael.**^[178]{.underline}^** Aharon, not Moshe, was the only choice for achieving a similar annulment of Divine wrath on behalf of all Bnai Yisrael, for through that, he too would be redeemed. For just as Aharon had been punished through the death of his two eldest sons, with incense as the lightning rod of Divine retribution, he could now save Bnai Yisrael by ending the suffering brought about by a second plague. And instead of incense being the tool leading to his sons' death, it became instead a tool leading to the sparing of countless lives.**^[179]{.underline}^**

Even this expanded explanation of Pesikta Rabbati, while shedding light on pesukim whose meanings are vague or unexplained, while simultaneously explaining the relationship between seemingly unrelated stories and connecting them all thematically, may not go far enough, and still hides some loose threads. In **The Introduction** we noted that Nadav and Avihu appear among the *atzilei bnai yisrael* atop Har Sinai, and in **Above and Below** we discussed how midrash looks to the first time a word or character appears in order to draw conclusions from it. What about Nadav and Avihus' first appearance in Shmot 24 has to do with their sin in Vayikra 10? Surely an experience such as that one should have lasting effects - could it be that perhaps Nadav and Avihu's sin was a consequence, an after-effect, of their overwhelming vision on Har Sinai? How, truly, could one encounter the Creator of the Universe in such a manner and not come out profoundly affected? And should we not expect the midrash to explore the full gamut of possibilities laden within this idea?



**Part 2: Delayed Punishment**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Nadav and Avihu being identified as members of a larger group called to ascend the mountain leaves open the question of who was witness to the revelation and subsequently spared from punishment. Who exactly were the *atzilei bnai yisrael*: everybody atop Har Sinai, or some subset of the selected few? In order to address this question we must first ask another question: what does *atzilei bnai yisrael* even mean? Many of the major commentaries on this pasuk understand *atzilei* to be a reference to Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders, to the exclusion of Moshe and Aharon.**^[180]{.underline}^** Yet one tradition has it that only Nadav and Avihu glimpsed G-d's glory on that day, without making any mention of the seventy elders:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

וּסְלֵיק משֶׁה וְאַהֲרן נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא וְשִׁבְעִין מִסָּבֵי יִשְרָאֵל: וּזְקָפוּ נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא יַת עֵינֵיהוֹן וְחָמוּן יַת אִיקַר אֱלָהָא דְיִשְרָאֵל וּתְחוֹת אַפִּיפּוּרִין דְּרִיגְלוֹי דְמַיְצַע תְּחוֹת כּוּרְסֵיהּ הֵי כְעוֹבַד אַבַן סַפִּירִינוּן מִידְכַּר שִׁעֲבּוּדָא דְשַׁעְבִּידוּ מִצְרָאֵי יַת בְּנֵי יִשְרָאֵל בְּטִינָא וּבְלִיבְנִין וַהֲווֹן נְשַׁיָא בָּטְשָׁן יַת טִינָא עִם גּוּבְרֵיהוֹן הֲוַת תַּמָּן רִיבָא מְפַנְקָתָא מַעְבַּרְתָּא וְאַפִּילַת יַת עוּבְרָא וְאִיתְבַּטַּשׁ עִם טִינָא נָחָת גַּבְרִיאֵל וְעָבַד מִנֵיהּ לְבֵינְתָא וְאַסְקֵיהּ לִשְׁמֵי מְרוֹמָא וְאַתְקְנֵיהּ גִּילוּגְדַק תְּחוֹת אַפִּיפּוּרִין דְּמָרֵי עַלְמָא זִיוֵיהּ הֵי כְּעוֹבַד אֲבַן טָבָא וְהֵי כִּתְקוּף שְׁפַר שְׁמַיָא כַּד הִינוּן בְּרִירִין מִן עֲנָנַיָא: וּלְוַת נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא עוּלֵמַיָא שַׁפִּירַיָא לָא שָׁדַר מַחְתֵּיהּ בְּהַהוּא שַׁעְתָּא בְּרַם אִתְנַטְרָא לְהוֹן לְיוֹם תְּמִינַיָא לְאַשְׁלָמוּתָא לְאַסְעָרָא עֲלֵיהוֹן וְחָמוֹן יַת אִיקַר שְׁכִינְתָּא דַיְיָ וַהֲווֹן חָדָן בְּקוּרְבָּנֵיהוֹן דְּאִתְקַבָּלוּ בְּרַעֲוָא הֵי כְאָכְלִין וְהֵי כְשַׁתְיָין:**^[181]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Moshe, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu and seventy elders of Yisrael ascended. Nadav and Avihu lifted up their eyes and saw the glory of the G-d of Yisrael. Under the footstool of His feet - which was placed beneath His throne - was the work of sapphire stone which was reminiscent of the servitude: that Egypt had enslaved Bnai Yisrael with clay and bricks. Once there were wives treading clay with their husbands, and there was one delicate young pregnant woman there as well. She miscarried because of how she was treading clay. Gavriel the angel came down and made a brick, and took it up to Heaven and placed it under the footstool of the Master of the World, whose splendor was like the work of great stone and like the power of the beauty of the skies when they are emptied of clouds. Against Nadav and Avihu, the pleasant young men, His strike was not sent at that time; rather, it was waiting for them on the eighth day, for retribution to return and destroy them. They saw the glory of the Shechinah of Hashem, and were happy that their sacrifices had been accepted with favor, and they ate and drank."**^[181]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The first pasuk translated by Targum Yonatan is a simple, word-for-word rendering of the original Hebrew. The second pasuk's translation contains a midrash embedded within it that attempts to explain the significance of the sapphire stone, and can be found with some variation in other aggadic works as well.**^[182]{.underline}^** It is the third pasuk's translation, however, which interests us most: Nadav and Avihu are singled out and identified as *atzilei bnai yisrael* while the seventy elders, Moshe and Aharon are excluded. It also explains in what sense they were spared from His strike: punishment was delayed until the first of Nisan of the second year**^[183]{.underline}^** as retribution for the sin they committed.

Targum Yonatan makes a deep connection between Nadav and Avihu's glimpse of G-d on Har Sinai and their mysterious, supernatural death at the finale of the Mishkan's consecration, arguing that the reason they died was not for any of the sins mentioned earlier - drunkenness, arrogance, being unmarried, etc. - and not as a vicarious punishment meant for Aharon due to his complicit behavior at the sin of the golden calf as Peskita Rabbati claims, but for a different reason entirely: they were supposed to die on Har Sinai, but G-d spared them and waited until they brought a foreign fire to exact their sentence. It follows that this idea is both similar and different to each of the other midrashim.**^[184]{.underline}^**

This approach answers the linguistic question of who *atzilei bnai yisrael* were while also providing a thematic explanation of what the "staying of His hand" actually means. However, in some sense it raises as many questions as it answers, and it raises two incredibly important questions that are particularly noteworthy, namely:

- Targum Yonatan assumes that Nadav and Avihu were the only ones who were temporarily spared His hand. But the seventy elders, Moshe and Aharon were also present at the time; why should they not be included in the death sentence?

- If Nadav and Avihu were deserving of death, why didn't HaKadosh Baruch Hu send His hand and strike them down on the spot? And why was it at the Mishkan's consecration ceremony specifically that He decided to consume them with fire instead?

To answer these questions we will turn to a fascinating midrash quoted in the name of Rabbi Tanchuma, shocking in its audacity and scope.

**[Unified Storyline]{.underline}**

A variant on the midrash recorded in Targum Yonatan expands *atzilei bnai yisrael* to include not just Nadav and Avihu but also the seventy elders, and elaborates in great detail on the broader thematic ramifications of what exactly happened. The relevant sections are quoted at length here:

"'Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Yisrael' (Bemidbar 11:16)." This is as it says: 'One who loves purity of heart, has grace on his lips and a king as his friend' (Mishlei 22:11). Why doesn't it say 'Gather for Me seventy men in the plural'? Rather, these seventy on the Sanhedrin were singular individuals, similar to Me and you. Me, as it says: 'Hashem is a man of war' (Shmot 15:3), and you, as it says: 'And the man Moshe was very humble' (Bemidbar 12:3).

'Gather for Me'. Were there no elders already? By Har Sinai it already said: 'Moshe, Aaron and seventy men from the elders of Yisrael ascended' (Shmot 24:9), and this episode happened after that; where were those elders? Rather, when Yisrael reached this point: 'The nation was like complainers ... and a fire of Hashem burnt among them' (Bemidbar 11:1), the seventy elders were all burned at that time. And their burning was similar to the burning of Nadav and Avihu, for they too were too frivolous when they ascended Har Sinai and saw the Shechinah, as it says: 'They saw G-d, and ate and drank' (Shmot 24:11). Could they really have eaten and drank there? Rather it is a parable, what is this similar to? To a slave who watches over his master who has a loaf of bread in his hand, and he grabs it from him; so too they were frivolous as if they were eating and drinking rather than showing proper respect.

They deserved to be burned that very moment, that is the elders, Nadav and Avihu. But because it was Matan Torah which was beloved before HaKadosh Baruch Hu, therefore HaKadosh Baruch Hu did not want to touch them on that day and break out against them, which is why it says: 'He did not send His hand against the nobles of Bnai Yisrael' (Shmot 24:11), which implies that they deserved a sending of the hand. But after some time, they received their comeuppance: Nadav and Avihu were burned when they entered the Ohel Moed, and the elders were burned when they had that desire, as it says: 'And the riffraff in the nation's midst had a great desire' (Bemidbar 11:4).

What was the riffraff? Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani and Rabbi Nechemiah. One of them says, they were the converts that went up with Bnai Yisrael from Egypt and gathered unto them, as it says: 'And a great multitude went up with them' (Shmot 12:38). The other one says, the riffraff is none other than the Sanhedrin, as it says: 'Gather for me seventy men'. What does it say there? 'A fire of Hashem burned them and consumed the edge of the camp', meaning those who were selected from the camp i.e. the Sanhedrin.

How do we know that those elders that had ascended Har Sinai had been burned? As it says: 'A fire burned in their assembly' (Tehillim 106:18), and there is no assembly other than the Sanhedrin, as it says: 'If it would be concealed from the eyes of the assembly' (Bemidbar 18:24), and it says: 'If the entire assembly of Yisrael will sin accidentally' (Vayikra 4:13). Similarly David said: 'Even G-d went up against them and killed their sturdiest ones' (Tehillim 78:31) - these are the Sanhedrin; 'And struck down the chosen of Yisrael' - those young ones that were called elders, as it says: 'David also added to the chosen in Yisrael' (Shmuel Bet 6:1) ...

At that time, HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe, appoint other elders instead of those elders, as it says: 'Gather for Me seventy men'. 'I shall descend and speak with you there', to tell you that the day the elders were appointed was as precious to HaKadosh Baruch Hu as the day of Matan Torah, as it says: 'On the third day Hashem will descend' (Shmot 19:11), and so too the appointment of the elders was done with descent ...

Rather know Moshe that from Mine the elders shall take nothing but rather from yours, as it says: 'I will set aside from the spirit upon you and put it on them, and they will carry the burden with you' (Bemidbar 11:17). Yet even so, Moshe lacked nothing. You know this because even after forty years HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'Take Yehoshua Bin Nun, a man with spirit in him, and give him some of your glory' (Bemidbar 27:18-20). What does it say regarding Yehoshua? 'Yehoshua Bin Nun was filled with a spirit of wisdom' (Devarim 34:9). Why? 'Because Moshe had placed his hands on him'

HaKadosh Baruch Hu said, in this world individuals prophesy, but in the world to come all of Yisrael will be prophets, as it says: 'After these things I will spill out My spirit on all flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy' (Yoel 3:1). This is the exposition of Rabbi Tanchuma Bar Abba."**^[185]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The reason Nadav and Avihus' death and the complainers' death are both described using identical language - consumed by a fire that went out from before Hashem - is because they were being punished for the same transgression: seeing G-d on Har Sinai. They showed disrespect at a moment of Divine revelation, acted lightheartedly and impudently, in a moment of fatal misjudgment. Although their verdict was sealed at that very moment - for *"man cannot see G-d and live"* - Hashem spared them at that moment out of deference and respect for the Torah:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Also from here: 'He did not send His hand against the nobles of Bnai Yisrael' (Shmot 24:11). Rabbi Pinchas said, from here derive that they deserve a sending of the hand. Rabbi Hoshaya said, did they take delicacies with them to Sinai that you say: 'They said G-d, and ate and drank' (Shmot 24:11)? Rather, this teaches that they glanced at the Shechinah in a disrespectful way, like a man who glances at his friend when he is eating and drinking ...

'In the desert of Sinai' - and did they die in the desert of Sinai? Rather, this teaches that they took their verdict for death at Sinai. A parable: this is comparable to a king who is accompanying his daughter, and he finds in his servants something inappropriate. The king says, if I kill them now, I will ruin my daughter's happiness; tomorrow it is only my happiness, and better to punish them during my happiness and not my daughter's happiness. Similarly HaKadosh Baruch Hu said, if I kill Nadav and Avihu now, I am ruining the happiness of the Torah; tomorrow it is only My happiness at the Mishkan's consecration. Better at My happiness than the Torah's happiness. This is as it says: 'On the day of his wedding" (Shir HaShirim 3:11) - this is Sinai; 'And the day of his heart's happiness' - this is the Ohel Moed i.e. Mishkan."**^[186]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This midrash interprets His hand not being sent as an act of mercy, but rather one of consideration and empathy for the honor of the Torah, and preempts the obvious question of how killing Nadav and Avihu during the zenith of happiness and celebration at the Mishkan's inauguration is any better by explaining the difference between Matan Torah and the Ohel Moed: the Torah represents a covenant between HaKadosh Baruch Hu and Bnai Yisrael, and as such is an entity that was destined from the beginning of creation to be given in joy and happiness. The giving of the Torah justifies and validates the entire world, all of existence from time immemorial and for all time forevermore; such an event cannot be dampened, tainted by the deaths of the righteous. In contrast, while the Mishkan's completion was certainly a momentous event,**^[187]{.underline}^** one whole significance cannot be understated as it represented the worship that was destined to continue for over a thousands years in the Batei Mikdash, its importance is inferior to that of the Torah's precisely because it is a place for worshiping G-d: He is willing, even pleased, to forego His happiness, but the happiness bound up in Torah as being the pinnacle and purpose of mankind He is not willing to overlook.

Contained within this idea is a profound lesson in Imitatio Dei: G-d puts His childrens' honor before His own, not caring about dampening the excitement surrounding His house of worship but deeply sensitive to the Torah needing to be given in purity and wholeness to the Jewish people.
We too, the midrash gently encourages, should demonstrate a zeal for the honor of others coupled with an indifference regarding our own.

**[Thirsty Souls]{.underline}**

Were *atzilei bnai yisrael* told that their verdicts had just been sealed, their deaths assured at the slightest wrongdoing, their lives hanging by a thread in the balance between Heaven and earth? We are left in the dark both by the pesukim and the midrash as to whether the fact that G-d "stayed His hand" - if it indeed indicates the suspension of punishment - was ever made known to the guilty parties. It would be reasonable to assume, however, that had *atzilei bnai yisrael* known they were destined to die at any moment, they would be upset, terrified, frozen by the knowledge that their lives would forever be shaped by the cloud of inevitability that would thereafter hover over them constantly. From the fact that their response was to "eat and drink" we can perhaps make an educated guess: according to Rav who interprets this expression metaphorically as a description of the revelation the nobles experienced,**^[128]{.underline}^** this phrase does not add new information post-theophany but rather is an explanation of their vision; but according to Targum Yonatan**^[181]{.underline}^** and others who interpret the eating and drinking literally, we can infer that in fact this decision was not revealed to them immediately, for partaking in a festive meal does not seem an appropriate response to learning about one's own imminent demise.**^[188]{.underline}^**

If *atzilei bnai yisrael* were unaware that their futures were sealed, the logical next question to ask is: did they find out at any point between the vision at Matan Torah and their respective deaths? In particular: when Nadav and Avihu were suddenly and spontaneously consumed by fire after bringing their offering, had they acted in that way knowing that they were meant to die for any infraction? Or had they lived blissfully ignorant of the fate that awaited them?

Perhaps this is exactly how the midrash understands Moshe's cryptic words to Aharon after his sons' deaths. According to the Talmud**^[165]{.underline}^** this terrible secret was made known to Moshe in Shmot 29:43: *"I will meet Bnai Yisrael there and be sanctified in My honor"*, but Moshe did not pick up on its deeper meaning until Nadav and Avihu were consumed by fire. It is true that at their deaths Moshe realized that Aharon's sons had died to *"sanctify the name of HaKadosh Baruch Hu"*, but he also was hinting to his brother the horrifying implication: Nadav and Avihu had died because they had glimpsed G-d at Har Sinai, a certainty learned all too late by their father and uncle.

And what of Nadav and Avihus' guilt in their death - were they guilty of the sin described in the Torah; other, related sins; other, non-related sins; some combination; or entirely guiltless? It would seem according to Tanchuma Yelamdenu that Nadav and Avihu were in fact liable to the death penalty, but not directly due to a heinous act relating to the Mishkan, their bachelor lifestyle, or contempt for their elders. Rather, they died because they had seen G-d. This explanation fits nicely with the description of them immediately after their deaths as "My close ones": Nadav and Avihu were close to HaKadosh Baruch Hu in a very real sense, for they had actually seen Him enthroned in the heavens at Har Sinai, getting even closer to Him than humanly possible and yet living - albeit temporarily - to tell the tale. Indeed, while some midrashim clearly frame Nadav and Avihu as wicked and deserving of punishment, this tradition seems to say their only crime was coming too close to G-d, a crime that led to their being on borrowed time, to be exacted when they once again attempted to draw close to Him in a manner that was not permitted. Some midrashim go so far as to describe Nadav and Avihu as HaKadosh Baruch Hu's beloved, and as such He mourned over their death as a necessity evil:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיָּמָת נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא לִפְנֵי ה' (במדבר ג, ד), בְּכַמָּה מְקוֹמוֹת נִכְתְּבָה מִיתַת נָדָב וַאֲבִיהוּא, מְלַמֵּד שֶׁהָיָה צַעַר לִפְנֵי הַמָּקוֹם עֲלֵיהֶם, שֶׁהָיוּ בְּנֵי אַהֲרֹן חֲבִיבִים{.underline}, וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר (ויקרא י, ג): בִּקְרֹבַי אֶקָּדֵשׁ:**^[189]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'Nadav and Avihu died before Hashem' (Bemidbar 3:4). In several places the deaths of Nadav and Avihu are written, to teach that it was a source of distress before HaMakom, for the sons of Aharon were beloved, and similarly it says: 'I will be sanctified through My holy ones' (Vayikra 10:3)."**^[189]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The fact that Nadav and Avihus' death is recorded as having taken place *"before Hashem"* several times in the Torah - Vayikra 10, Bemidbar 3, Bemidbar 26 - is a redundancy not lost on the midrash: it teaches how beloved they were, and how tragic their deaths must have been in the eyes of HaKadosh Baruch Hu. Viewed in this light, consumption by Divine fire, instead of a harsh, destructive punishment, may perhaps instead be viewed as symbolic of a loving embrace, a way for G-d as it were to embrace His holy ones even as He cannot delay their sentence any further.

Could it be that Nadav and Avihu had been desperate to rejoin G-d and come close to Him after their sublime experience atop Har Sinai? Perhaps they yearned for a rendezvous with HaKadosh Baruch Hu, a rekindling of the closeness they had felt that auspicious day nearly a year prior. And yet, in the aftermath of the Golden Calf He was nowhere to be found, His presence no longer accessible to the people as it had once been.**^[190]{.underline}^** They had been searching for Him, thirsty to be with the the living G-d, trapped in a spiritual daze from their ecstatic vision and unable to return to normalcy. After Har Sinai, however, all hopes of connecting to G-d at that level were shattered along with the tablets. All hope seemed lost, until HaKadosh Baruch Hu forgave Bnai Yisrael and gave them the Mishkan as a path to atonement. Finally, G-d would return to His people, and His people would be able to draw close to Him again. After months of anticipation, the eight day inauguration ceremony comes to a close, and for the first time since Matan Torah HaKadosh Baruch Hu's presence rested among Bnai Yisrael once again. Could Nadav and Avihu be blamed for bringing an offering in the Mishkan? After an experience like the one they had, and after going from that high to despairing even encountering G-d again, His presence appears in the form of Divine fire,**^[191]{.underline}^** and they seize the opportunity, like rabid dogs jumping at the chance to become reacquainted with their Master. No wonder they are called His beloved; no wonder He is saddened by their untimely death.

It follows that although Nadav and Avihu did sin by bringing a foreign fire not commanded of them, that sin was more of a pretext to exact earlier punishment than something which deserved death in and of itself. This helps us reconcile the description of Aharon's sons actions as having been "not commanded" on the one hand while seeming too minor to warrant such a response on the other: HaKadosh Baruch Hu governs His beloved ones with strict justice to a hair's breadth,**^[192]{.underline}^** and therefore through the minor sin they committed punishment for an earlier transgression was visited upon them.

This line of thought also helps us understand why the complainers from Bemidbar 11:1 were destroyed. The Torah does not reveal who they were; this midrash teaches that they were the elders who saw G-d on Har Sinai. Complaining against G-d is a sin, albeit one that is not normally punishable by death, yet it was a pretext to carry out the delayed justice from Har Sinai. Yet what exactly was their sin at that time, and how does their sin - like that of Nadav and Avihu - connect to what had happened atop "the mountain of G-d"?

Immediately prior to the complainers' supernatural demise, the Torah tells us about Bnai Yisrael finally leaving Har Sinai after months of being encamped at the foot of the mountain. The clouds lifted from the Mishkan; the trumpets blasted, the flags marched: Bnai Yisrael journeyed from Har Sinai a distance of three days.**^[193]{.underline}^** Like Nadav and Avihu, the elders had been waiting for an opportunity to be with G-d; unlike Nadav and Avihu, as non-Kohanim they had not had the chance to enter the Kodesh HaKodashim and encounter G-d in the holiest section of the Mishkan. The elders were barred from sacrificial service reserved only for the priests, and so they waited impatiently to see when they too would have G-d reveal Himself in a way that they could access, that they could tap into and be nourished from as they had been on Har Sinai.

The Mishkan was finally erected on the first of Nisan in the second year; in their holy zeal to see the G-d of Yisrael once more, Nadav and Avihu perished. Moshe and Aharon were privy to the secret that *"I will be sanctified through My holy ones"*; perhaps the elders were not. It stands to reason that the deaths of Aharon's sons would not have stayed under wraps, and surely it was common knowledge. Yet what lay behind their death? That remained a mystery, revealed to no one but Moshe and told to no one but Aharon. The elders, however, remained in the dark, unaware of the danger inherent in their desires to be with Him and the comparable nature of Nadav and Avihus' fatal quest to do the same.

Seven weeks go by; the twentieth of Nisan comes and with it news that Bnai Yisrael are leaving Har Sinai. The elders are devastated: where is HaKadosh Baruch Hu? Leaving Har Sinai was tantamount to spiritual suicide for them, more so than the rest of Bnai Yisrael, for while everyone had heard His voice and seen His miracles, the elders had gone one impossible step further and seen G-d Himself. The tragic nature of Nadav and Avihus' death, their inability to come back down from the heavens after a successful ascension and live out a material, flawed life detached on some level from the Shechinah - such too was the fate of those elders who, unable to come to terms with the departure from Har Sinai, complain. Perhaps they even preceded the spies in not wanting to continue onto Eretz Canaan, but for an entirely different reason: they wanted to stay at Har Sinai, the place where they knew He was to be found. Their desire went too far, and manifested in a way unacceptable before their Creator; they too were irreversibly transformed by their experience, and therefore consumed by fire, taken from the physical world before their time. Yet they too were beloved by G-d, their deaths ultimately tragic as well.**^[194]{.underline}^**

This interpretation of Shmot 24:9-11 and how its consequences reverberate in subsequent challenging narratives resolves a myriad of grammatical and linguistic difficulties, and ties together a host of thematic and literary loose ends. Yet it also develops and demonstrates critical cornerstones of Rabbinic theology concerning the way G-d governs the world and metes out justice. In particular, there is a strong emphasis placed on the importance of *middah keneged middah*, the idea that people are punished in line with what transgression they committed. Nadav, Avihu and the elders should never have seen HaKadosh Baruch Hu, and perhaps they also acted too frivolously in that exalted moment; they could not resume normal life, instead wanting to return to Him, continuing the transgression a second time,**^[195]{.underline}^** unable to separate above and below. Indeed, if we understand the eating and drinking done at Har Sinai as spiritual nourishment from the Shechinah, it becomes clear how the way the respective deaths were carried out was fitting. The same root denoting consumption - אכל] - appears in all these stories, tying together the sin with its corollary punishment: just as Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders ate, consumed, drank in, the G-d of Yisrael, so too He consumed them with fire:

וַיִּקְח֣וּ בְנֵֽי אַ֠הֲרֹ֠ן נָדָ֨ב וַאֲבִיה֜וּא אִ֣ישׁ מַחְתָּת֗וֹ וַיִּתְּנ֤וּ בָהֵן֙ אֵ֔שׁ וַיָּשִׂ֥ימוּ עָלֶ֖יהָ קְטֹ֑רֶת וַיַּקְרִ֜יבוּ לִפְנֵ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֵ֣שׁ זָרָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֧ר לֹ֦א צִוָּ֖ה אֹתָֽם׃ וַתֵּ֥צֵא אֵ֛שׁ מִלִּפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה וַתֹּ֣אכַל אוֹתָ֑ם וַיָּמֻ֖תוּ לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה: (ויקרא י:א, ב)

וַיְהִ֤י הָעָם֙ כְּמִתְאֹ֣נְנִ֔ים רַ֖ע בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ וַיִּ֣חַר אַפּ֔וֹ וַתִּבְעַר בָּם֙ אֵ֣שׁ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַתֹּ֖אכַל בִּקְצֵ֥ה הַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃ ... וְהָֽאסַפְסֻף֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּקִרְבּ֔וֹ הִתְאַוּ֖וּ תַּאֲוָ֑ה וַיָּשֻׁ֣בוּ וַיִּבְכּ֗וּ גַּ֚ם בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ מִ֥י יַאֲכִלֵ֖נוּ בָּשָֽׂר (במדבר יא:א, ד)

**[Angelic Guidance]{.underline}**

While the concept of *middah keneged middah* is applied within the bounds of reward and punishment in the traditional sense, this midrash also extends the concept even further in a broader sense as well. Given that the source of Nadav and Avihus' death was entirely non-physical - a spiritual malady brought on by a spiritual confrontation - it demanded an entirely non-physical response. Aharon's sons had been transmuted by their experience from regular men into men that had been unified with the Divine in mystical union. The Nadav and Avihu - and for that matter, the seventy elders - who existed before Shmot 24 were not the same people as those after Shmot 24, for their souls had basked in the glory of the Shechinah. As such, it is fitting that their souls would want to cleave to their Divine source, be unable to survive an ephemeral existence for much longer. This approach aligns nicely with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, who maintained that their souls were burned by the fire while their bodies remained intact, and in opposition to the opinion of Abba Yosi Ben Dostai, who says nothing of souls but insists it was their bodies that charred to a crisp instead.**^[144]{.underline}^** Similarly, Rabbi Eliezer's description of Nadav and Avihus' bodies being forcefully ejected from the Kodesh HaKodashim carries with it a reckoning carries out in the non-physical plane, as opposed to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva's description of their bodies being dragged out by spears.**^[155]{.underline}^**

We find in Rabbi Eliezer's opinion a description of an angel being the arbiter of punishment as opposed to HaKadosh Baruch Hu himself. This addition to the story is made intentionally, as it further cements the non-physical nature of the sin and its consequences: it is an angel who comes and removes Nadav and Avihus' souls, returning them to the Creator they so desired to cleave to. Yet there is perhaps a broader significance to the angel's appearance as well: oftentimes when the text is describing HaKadosh Baruch Hu as involved in carrying out an act that can be perceived as destructive or unjust, one technique employed by later interpretive schools was to insert Divine messengers as the executors in this world. This was understood to "remove" G-d Himself in some sense from direct involvement in the tragedy; reapportioning the blame of visiting what can be perceived as excessive death or destruction on mankind to an angel lessens the blatant nature of the theological difficulty somewhat.**^[196]{.underline}^** If, as described in the midrashim, HaKadosh Baruch Hu mourned the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, executing His beloved because they needed to die and not because He desired to, explaining this uncomfortable punishment carried out by an angel of destruction instead of G-d Himself makes a lot of sense.

The Talmud also makes mention of an angel orchestrating the initial events of Shmot 24:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אמר רב נחמן האי מאן דידע לאהדורי למינים כרב אידית ליהדר ואי לא לא ליהדר אמר ההוא מינא לרב אידית כתיב (שמות כד, א) ואל משה אמר עלה אל ה' עלה אלי מיבעי ליה א"ל זהו מטטרון ששמו כשם רבו דכתיב (שמות כג, כא) כי שמי בקרבו אי הכי ניפלחו ליה כתיב (שמות כג, כא) אל תמר בו אל תמירני בו אם כן לא ישא לפשעכם למה לי א"ל הימנותא בידן דאפילו בפרוונקא נמי לא קבילניה דכתיב (שמות לג, טו) ויאמר אליו אם אין פניך הולכים וגו׳:**^[197]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rav Nachman said, one who knows how to respond to heretics like Rav Idit should respond, but if not, he should not respond. Once a heretic said to Rav Idit, it says: 'He said to Moshe, ascend to Hashem' (Shmot 24:1) - it should have said, come up to Me? He said to him, that was Metatron, whose name was like that of his Master, as it says: 'My name is in him' (Shmot 23:21). If so, let us worship him? It says: 'Do not defy him' - do not replace Me with him. If so, why do I need: 'He will not pardon your transgression'? He said to him, we believe that we did not accept an angel even as a guide for the journey, as it says: 'And he said to him: If Your Presence go not with me, don't raise me out of here' (Shmot 33:15)."**^[197]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The context of the conversation between Rav Idit and the heretic is polemical in nature, and comes on the heels of esoteric metaphysical discussions surrounding the danger inherent in knowledge of multiple Divine thrones leading someone astray and towards gnostic apostasy if not understood correctly.**^[198]{.underline}^** According to Rav Idit, it is the archangel Metatron, and not HaKadosh Baruch Hu Himself, who called Moshe and the *atzilei bnai yisrael* up the mountain. The grammatical issue raised by the heretic - namely, that Hashem refers to Himself in the third person - is solved by Rav Idit's answer, but there may be deeper thematic significance being developed here too. The fallout from this episode was terrible, culminating in the untimely deaths of *atzilei bnai yisrael*; G-d Himself had His "forced" to carry out a seeming injustice. By placing the blame of calling Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders up the mountain squarely at the feet of angel - such Metatron, as Rav Idit does, or Michael, as per the translation of Targum Yonatan**^[134]{.underline}^** - the midrash is sidestepping the issue by relegating the ramifications of their deaths to be the archangel's responsibility.**^[199]{.underline}^**

Rav Idit's strategy of helping the Divine evade direct responsibility proves useful in light of a radically shocking comment made by the Tur HaAroch in his commentary on Shmot 24:1:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
תימא לי למה לא עלו אלעזר ואיתמר שהרי גדולה מעלתם ממעלת הזקנים ... ונ"ל משום שהקב"ה לו נתכנו עלילות (שמואל א ב, ג) וידע שבעלילה זו נתחייבו כדאמרינן שמכאן נתחייבו שריפה אלא שלא רצה הקב"ה לערבב שמחת התורה והמתין לנדב ואביהו עד יום שמיני של מלואים ולזקנים עד תבערה ואילו מתו אלעזר ואיתמר היה נכרת כל זרע אהרן ולא רצה הקב"ה שיכרת זרע כהונה הקדושה:**^[200]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"I find it puzzling that Elazar and Itamar were not included in this invitation. Surely they were more distinguished than the seventy elders mentioned in our verse ... It seems to me that because before HaKadosh Baruch Hu: 'All possibilities are laid out' (Shmuel Aleph 2:3), and He knew that from this episode they would become liable for death, as it says that from here they were liable to be burnt but HaKadosh Baruch Hu did not want to dampen the joy of Torah, and so He waited to punish Nadav and Avihu until the eighth day of the consecration and He waited to punish the elders until Tav'eira. If Elazar and Itamar had died also, all the offspring of Aharon would have been cut off, and HaKadosh Baruch Hu didn't want the holy Kehunah to be completely cut off and therefore He did not invite them up the mountain with their brothers."**^[200]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The Tur is grappling with a question which has not been addressed yet: why were *atzilei bnai yisrael* singled out to ascend the mountain? More to the point, why were two of Aharon's sons invited while two were excluded - what happened to Elazar and Itamar?**^[201]{.underline}^** Out of seeming desperation, he provides a theologically mind-blowing suggestion, one not even hinted at in the midrashic literature. Since HaKadosh Baruch Hu knows everything that will unfold, He must have known that *atzilei bnai yisrael* would not avert their gazes and incur death at the sight of G-d seated on His throne. Additionally, He wanted to avoid the destruction of Aharon's lineage, since they were destined to become the Kohanim. Since He knew that Elazar and Itamar would be liable for death if they were to ascend the mountain, He specifically did not command them to ascend, so that there would be a remnant remaining after Nadav and Avihu met their demise.**^[202]{.underline}^**

There could be yet another, additional layer of thematic consistency and unity being promoted by Rav Idit's insertion of Metatron into the story of Har Sinai. Among the myriad of angels in the Heavenly court Metatron ranks among the highest, yet it is his origin story that sets him apart:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיְהִ֖י כׇּל יְמֵ֣י חֲנ֑וֹךְ חָמֵ֤שׁ וְשִׁשִּׁים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁלֹ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה׃ וַיִּתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ חֲנ֖וֹךְ אֶת הָֽאֱלֹהִ֑ים וְאֵינֶ֕נּוּ כִּֽי לָקַ֥ח אֹת֖וֹ אֱלֹהִֽים:**^[203]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"All the days of Hanoch were 365 years. Hanoch walked with G-d, and was no more, for G-d took him."**^[203]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Metatron had originally been a mortal human being named Hanoch who had been taken alive by G-d and transformed into an archangel:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַהֲווֹ כָּל יוֹמֵי חֲנוֹךְ עִם דַיְירֵי אַרְעָא תְּלַת מְאָה וְשִׁיתִּין וַחֲמֵשׁ שְׁנִין: וּפְלַח חֲנוֹךְ בְּקוּשְׁטָא קֳדָם יְיָ וְהָא לֵיתוֹהִי עִם דַיְירֵי אַרְעָא אֲרוּם אִתְנְגִיד וְסַלִיק לִרְקִיעָא בְּמֵימַר קָדָם יְיָ וּקְרָא שְׁמֵיהּ מִיטַטְרוֹן סַפְרָא רַבָּא:**^[204]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"All the days that Hanoch was with those who dwell on earth equaled 365 years. Hanoch served truthfully before Hashem and behold, he was not among those who live in the world, for he was withdrawn. He ascended to the heavens by the word of G-d, and his name was Metatron, the great teacher."**^[204]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is no shortage of fantastic explanations as to why or how this process occurred,**^[205]{.underline}^** but for our purposes the takeaway is simple: perhaps the reason Metatron was chosen to call up *atzilei bnai yisrael* to experience a vision of G-d and become
transformed by it was because he himself in his life as the mortal Hanoch had walked with G-d and survived crossing over the threshold from physical to spiritual. He was the most appropriate candidate to command Nadav, Avihu and the elders on how to enter the paradise of the Shechinah and experience G-d as he had done thousands of years earlier. Unfortunately the calling was too great, the mission too lofty: Aharon's sons and the elders failed where Hanoch had succeeded.**^[206]{.underline}^**

**[Blurry Vision]{.underline}**

If we take Tanchuma Yelamdenu at its word, the revelation of Shmot 24 must have involved the G-d of Yisrael revealing Himself fully, without any filters or separations, at a level which man cannot endure or comprehend what he encounters, an experience so overwhelming that his soul departs. Yet there are other examples in Tanach of prophets and leaders having visions of the Divine on His throne, and there is no talk of it being a fatal encounter:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"It was taught: Shimon Ben Azzai says, I found a scroll of lineages in Yerushalayim, and it said three things: So-and-so is a mamzer from an adulterous union with a married woman; the teachings of Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yaakov are few, but pure; Menashe king of Yisrael murdered Yishayahu the prophet. Rava said, Menashe judged Yishayahu for making false statements against the Torah and killed him. He said to him, your teacher Moshe said: 'No person can see Me and live' (Shmot 33:20), yet you said: 'I saw Hashem sitting on a high and lofty throne' (Yishayahu 6:1) ... Yishayahu said, I know that Menashe will not accept whatever I say to him anyway, and if I do say something, it will make him an intentional murderer. Yishayahu said the holy Name, and was swallowed up by a cedar tree. They brought the cedar tree and sawed through it, and as it got to Yishayahu's mouth he died; this was because he had said: 'I dwell among a nation of impure lips (Yishayahu 6:5). In any event, how do we resolve the contradiction? As it was taught: all the prophets saw G-d observed through an obscure looking glass, while Moshe Rabbeinu observed through a transparent looking glass."**^[207]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Yishayahu is confronted by nobody less than the wicked king Menashe who accuses him of prophesying falsely. If you really saw what you claim to have seen, Menashe asks, how did you survive? The answer given by the Talmud is that there was a qualitative difference between Moshe's level of prophecy and everybody else's. Moshe saw *panim el panim*, without any distortion or obscurity, while the prophets received everything through riddles and a haze of confusion. The answer is therefore quite simple: even though Yishayahu's vision as it's described sounds like the real deal, it was refracted through a lens, a prism so that he could process it and be able to survive, though that also means it came at the cost of translucence and clarity.

As the debate in the Talmud takes place between Menashe and Yishayahu, it is logical for the paradigmatic use case brought as a challenge to Shmot 33:20 of a prophet who sees G-d and lives is Yishayahu. Yet, would it not be an even stronger question if asked from the Torah itself? HaKadosh Baruch Hu tells Moshe that no one may see His face and live in the aftermath of the Golden Calf, yet not even two months prior an entire group of elders did just that. While we could answer that, like Yishayahu, Yechezkel and anyone who is not Moshe, their prophecy was diluted, as through perceived through a dirty looking glass, yet the question remains: why did the Talmud not raise the contradiction from the story of Shmot 24?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
הא דלא קשיא ליה בתורה גופה מדכתיב ויראו את א-לקי ישראל ותחת רגליו וגו' י"ל דראו אחוריו כמפורש בקרא וראית את אחורי ופני לא יראו אבל ואראה את ה' יושב על כסא משמע ליה שראה הפנים:**^[208]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The fact that it did not ask from the Torah itself, as it says: 'They saw the G-d of Yisrael, and under His feet, etc. - we could suggest that atzilei bnai yisrael saw His back, as it says: 'You shall see My back but you shall not see My face'. In contrast: 'I saw Hashem sitting on a throne', which implies that Yishayahu saw His face."**^[208]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Maharsha suggests that the reason *atzilei bnai yisrael*'s survival is not a good question to raise is because they saw G-d's back, not His face, whereas Yishayahu saw His face; in other words, Shmot 24's revelation was a lower level of prophecy than Yishayahu 6, which itself was lower than a Moshe-style prophecy perceived through a see-through looking glass.**^[209]{.underline}^**

This answer forces us to accept that the level achieved by *atzilei bnai yisrael* on top of Har Sinai was lower than the level of Yishayahu while he was prophesying, which seems counter-intuitive. Additionally, the distinction Maharsha draws between the visions is subtle at best: both groups saw G-d sitting on His throne along with His footstool, so why assume that Yishayahu saw His face while the nobles saw His back?

The midrash's understanding of what actually occurred to the nobles can provide an answer to Maharsha's question:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
ועוד יש מקום לומר כי עיקר מה שמצא מנשה בדברי ישעיה סתירה לדברי משה הוא וח״י כלומר אם יזדמן אם יראה האדם אותו יתברך שוב לא יחיה אבל ימות והנה שבעים זקנים ונדב ואביהוא אשר הועד עליהם ויראו את א-לקי ישראל נגזרה עליהם מיתה באמת אלא שלא רצה הקב״ה לערבב שמחת התורה והמתין לנדב ואביהוא וכו ולזקנים וכו כמו שפירש רש״י שם. וישעיה העיד על עצמו כי המלאך הגיע על פיו ואמר לו וסר עונך וחטאתך תכופר כלומר ולא תמות וזהו עצמות הניגוד והסתירה]:**^[210]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"There is also room to suggest that the main problem Menashe had with Yishayahu's words contradicting Moshe's words was in regards to 'and live', meaning that if a man has an opportunity to see Him he will not live, but die. However, the seventy elders, Nadav and Avihu, about whom it was stated: 'They saw the G-d of Yisrael' - death was actually decreed for them, just that HaKadosh Baruch Hu did not want to dilute the joy of Torah, so He waited for Nadav and Avihu, etc. for the elders, etc. as Rashi explains. In contrast Yishayahu testified regarding himself that an angel touched his mouth and said to him: 'Now your sin is removed and your iniquity is atoned for', meaning that you will not die. This is the essence of the contradiction."**^[210]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This approach flips the question on its head: instead of accepting the question's premise and trying to differentiate between the prophecy of Yishayahu and the revelation of the nobles, it instead rejects the question's premise and asks: who said that the nobles survived? If we understand the idea that: *'Man cannot see Me and live'* to mean generally, but not necessarily that death is spontaneous and immediate, then in fact not only is Shmot 24 not a contradiction to this idea but rather its strongest support: Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders all saw G-d, and perished. They did live a few additional months to a year, but that was out of joy over Matan Torah; the nobles were an application of the rule, not the exception.

When all the dust settles we have a new midrashic approach to relieve us of many of the questions first raised in the context of Nadav and Avihu and the bizarre foreign fire incident. Along the way this solution also provided us with a whole host of additional grammatical resolutions and thematic connections to other sections of the Torah, in particular Shmot 24 and Bemidbar 11. It is here that the midrashic tale of Tanchuma Yelamdenu ends, resting content and satisfied. Yet there is one glaring question that seems to go unaddressed by the midrashim, one which demands attention and one which we can ask - and answer - in a satisfactory way. We hope to accomplish this by taking all the theories and concepts developed thus far in the aggadic tradition, and extrapolating them one major step further. All the groundwork has already been laid out for this exercise, and it is simply a matter of putting all the pieces of this puzzle together.



**Part 3: The Missing Layer**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

The nation has wandered for forty years, and as they near their final destination the new generation begins to get restless. Quickly the sins of their parents are forgotten, the punishments they endured are a long-distant memory. And yet, there are those who do remember what the nation had to overcome in its infancy and throughout the decades of aimless wandering. Moshe and Aharon, the last survivors of an older generation, whose lives were dedicated to their people's survival, at the cusp of the Promised Land are dealing with problems that are all too familiar. Just after the devastating death of his only sister Miriam the people regurgitate a complaint that Moshe has heard before nearly verbatim nearly forty years earlier:

</div>

Throughout the ages much ink has been spilled attempting to explain what exactly Moshe did wrong and why he was punished so harshly. Moshe had given his life to getting Bnai Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael, and now just before the finish line he finds out he cannot cross it. The disproportionate harshness of G-d's response and the deaf ear He has towards Moshe's prayers have troubled many commentators. Was Moshe's sin really so terrible?

The question is exacerbated when we compare the two stories above and realize how they are nearly identical. The classic explanation that Moshe should have spoken to the rock instead of hitting it**^[213]{.underline}^** is difficult to accept, not just because it seems too trivial of a transgression, but also because in the first iteration of this story at Masa U'Merivah Moshe is commanded from the start to hit the rock. If hitting the rock was such a problem, why was it the preferred solution forty years prior? Solutions have been offered to this problem but they tend to ring hollow: whatever difference between the two cases we can draw pales in scale to the difference in reaction and punishment that each occurrence was followed by.

Although the pesukim themselves make it abundantly clear that it was because of this sin that Moshe and Aharon were condemned to die in the wilderness,**^[214]{.underline}^** various midrashim offer other suggestions to explain what was really underlying Moshe and Aharons' punishment.**^[215]{.underline}^** Yet many of these these approaches do not give a satisfactory accounting of what the difference between Masa U'Merivah and Mei Merivah was, or why HaKadosh Baruch Hu seems to place all the emphasis on the lack of sanctification that Moshe's actions led to. Could there be another approach to Moshe's sin, one that not only explains the intra-story context and phrases while also fitting this into the inter-story narrative of Moshe's life and mission?

**[Hanging in the Balance]{.underline}**

The key to understanding what happened at Mei Merivah is recognizing the following: while there is a lack of consensus between the commentaries and midrashim regarding whether the term *atzilei bnai yisrael* refers to Aharon's sons only, or whether it includes the seventy elders as well,**^[216]{.underline}^** there is a general agreement that it does not refer to two other members of the nobility that were present as well, namely Moshe and Aharon.**^[217]{.underline}^** But is this really a necessary distinction? When the G-d of Yisrael and His footstool were seen (whatever that means), were Moshe and Aharon privy to that vision as well? Because if so, they too would have "seen G-d's face" and could not continue living; they too would have required a "staying of His hand" to postpone their ineluctable fate for the sake of not muddying the joy and happiness of Matan Torah; and they too would have been judged extremely harshly, existing until the slightest infraction provides the opportunity to visit upon them the sentence that was sealed on Har Sinai.

Remember that Moshe only came to understand what the ambiguous phrase *"I will be sanctified among My close ones"* truly meant when Aharon's sons were killed, telling Aharon that he had initially thought it meant one of them was destined to die *al kiddush hashem*.**^[165]{.underline}^** It follows that Moshe was initially unaware that the nobles' experience at Har Sinai had anything to do with G-d's cryptic warning, instead assuming it both limited in context of the Mishkan's construction and limited in scope to a specific person. Ironically, Moshe's worry that G-d would be sanctified through him or Aharon ended up being well founded, but for the wrong reason: they too were at Har Sinai and incurred the death penalty, and they too would have their death sentence visited upon them at the slightest infraction. Where Moshe erred was not making the connection to the vision of Shmot 24, and therefore failing to realize that G-d was not going to be sanctified through the death of a great individual, but rather through the collective death of an esteemed group of men: all the nobles who saw the G-d of Yisrael that fateful day several months prior.

Upon hearing Moshe's words, we are told that Aharon was silent. It could have been due to one or more of several emotions: shock, acceptance, comfort. Now it is crystal clear that another powerful emotion is driving Aharon's silence: fear. When Moshe communicated to Aharon that the deaths his sons was a sanctification of G-d's name, Aharon understood the horror of what that implied: that he and Moshe were also in danger, also subject to dying for the sake of G-d's glory at the slightest deviation from what they were commanded to do. Aharon is silent because he is afraid to speak, frozen by the creeping realization that the rest of his and his brothers' lives are on borrowed time, and likely to end swiftly at any moment.

Nadav and Avihu were consumed by Divine fire on the first day of Nisan in the second year,**^[218]{.underline}^** and from that day forward Moshe and Aharon lived in a constant state of anxiety and existential terror, for they knew that the Angel of Death was awaiting them, HaKadosh Baruch Hu was preparing for His great name's sanctification at even the most minor infraction. Their existence continued in a state of constant limbo, one foot among the living and one foot among the dead; forced to continue on, propelled forward by a mission bigger than themselves, yet all the while totally aware that they cannot afford to slip up.

The first of Nisan comes and goes, and nothing particularly interesting happens until seven weeks later: the clouds of glory rise up, and Bnai Yisrael embark on a three day journey to Midbar Paran. It is not clear if, like Moshe and Aharon, the seventy elders were aware they were living on borrowed time, but they complained. Their complaint is "evil in the ears of Hashem" and they too are consumed by Divine command. Moshe and Aharon surely realize that among those who stood atop Har Sinai only they too remain; the rest had committed questionable acts that, while it was not the most righteous, exemplary behavior, had nevertheless led to their deaths. Surely the fear felt after Nadav and Avihu were burned up became heightened, wound up to another pitch: who knows if they would survive another seven weeks?

As if that weren't confirmation enough, after the seventy elders are destroyed and a new group of elders is appointed in their stead, something unexpected occurs: two men named Eldad and Meidad begin to prophesy without cease in the camp:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיִּשָּׁאֲר֣וּ שְׁנֵֽי אֲנָשִׁ֣ים ׀ בַּֽמַּחֲנֶ֡ה שֵׁ֣ם הָאֶחָ֣ד ׀ אֶלְדָּ֡ד וְשֵׁם֩ הַשֵּׁנִ֨י מֵידָ֜ד וַתָּ֧נַח עֲלֵהֶ֣ם הָר֗וּחַ וְהֵ֙מָּה֙ בַּכְּתֻבִ֔ים וְלֹ֥א יָצְא֖וּ הָאֹ֑הֱלָה וַיִּֽתְנַבְּא֖וּ בַּֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃ וַיָּ֣רׇץ הַנַּ֔עַר וַיַּגֵּ֥ד לְמֹשֶׁ֖ה וַיֹּאמַ֑ר אֶלְדָּ֣ד וּמֵידָ֔ד מִֽתְנַבְּאִ֖ים בַּֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃ וַיַּ֜עַן יְהוֹשֻׁ֣עַ בִּן נ֗וּן מְשָׁרֵ֥ת מֹשֶׁ֛ה מִבְּחֻרָ֖יו וַיֹּאמַ֑ר אֲדֹנִ֥י מֹשֶׁ֖ה כְּלָאֵֽם׃ וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה הַֽמְקַנֵּ֥א אַתָּ֖ה לִ֑י וּמִ֨י יִתֵּ֜ן כׇּל עַ֤ם יְהֹוָה֙ נְבִיאִ֔ים כִּי יִתֵּ֧ן יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת רוּח֖וֹ עֲלֵיהֶֽם:**^[219]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Two men remained in the camp; one was named Eldad and the other was named Meidad. The spirit rested upon them - they were among those recorded, but they had not left the tent - and they prophesied in the camp. The boy ran and told Moshe and said, Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp. Yehoshua Bin Nun, Moshe's attendant from his youth, answered and said, Moshe my master, arrest them. Moshe said to him, are you zealous on my account? If only the entire nation of Hashem were prophets, that Hashem would give His spirit upon them."**^[219]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

While the pesukim do not detail Eldad and Meidad they prophesied about, as per usual we find that the midrash fills in the gap for us:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רבי שמעון אומר במחנה נשתיירו בשעה שאמר לו הקב"ה למשה אספה לי שבעים איש אמרו אלדד ומידד אין אנו ראויין לאותה גדולה אמר הקב"ה הואיל ומיעטתם עצמכם הריני מוסיף גדולה על גדולתכם ומה גדולה הוסיף להם שהנביאים כולן נתנבאו ופסקו והם נתנבאו ולא פסקו ומה נבואה נתנבאו אמרו משה מת יהושע מכניס את ישראל לארץ:**^[220]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Shimon said Eldad and Meidad remained in the camp, for when HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'Gather for me seventy men', Eldad and Meidad said, we are not worthy of this greatness. HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to them, because you have humbled yourselves, I am adding greatness to your greatness. What greatness did he add for them? That the other prophets stopped prophesying but they did not stop. And what did they prophesy about? They said Moshe will die and Yehoshua will lead Yisrael into Eretz Canaan."**^[220]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Where does the Talmud conjure this idea up from? Since Yehoshua reacted so strongly to their prophecy, it would follow that he and Moshe were both involved somehow, but where does Moshe's premature death come from? If Moshe intuited from Aharon's sons' deaths that he was in danger, and if the seventy elders dying acted as a confirmation, this was truly the nail in Moshe's proverbial coffin confirming his deepest fears: he would not merit to join the people in their redemption, and would instead suffer the same fate as the rest of *atzilei bnai yisrael*. Yehoshua, knowing none of this backstory, bristles with indignation and attempts to defend his master's honor, yet Moshe brushes him off for he suspects the truth: Eldad and Meidad's prophecy is doomed to be fulfilled.

**[Full Circle]{.underline}**

Moshe fears the worst, but at this point in Bnai Yisrael's sojourn everyone expected that the people's entrance into Eretz Yisrael was imminent, for it was from Midbar Paran that Moshe sent the twelve spies to scout out the land. Then, disaster strikes: an entire generation condemned to die in the wilderness. 38 years pass, all the while the people are slowly passing away; Moshe knows deep down he will not enter the land, yet is terrified of acting in any way that will upset his Creator. And as the final year of wandering approaches, Moshe finds himself and his brother still very much alive, and he cannot help but wonder: is it possible that Eldad and Meidad were mistaken, that I will survive and lead Bnai Yisrael into the Promised Land? Hope begins to bubble up inside him, yet it is coupled with disbelief and skepticism at his own excitement.

Then, it happens: on the first of Nisan in the fortieth year,**^[221]{.underline}^** exactly 38 years after Nadav and Avihu had perished in a fiery blaze, Moshe's sister Miriam dies. Moshe loses his composure and succumbs to anger, something he had largely managed to control and avoid since the seventy elders had been destroyed.**^[222]{.underline}^** Moshe strikes the rock twice instead of speaking to it, causing it to gush forth water, and is condemned along with his brother Aharon to die before bringing Bnai Yisrael into Eretz Yisrael. Almost as surprising as the extreme nature of Moshe's punishment is the lack of immediate response on Moshe's part. Perhaps this is another motivation behind the Talmud's statement that Eldad and Meidad had already spilled the beans to Moshe decades earlier: Moshe did not react then because he was unsurprised;**^[223]{.underline}^** he had been expecting this for a very long time, for the last of *atzilei bnai yisrael* had finally been found guilty of a wrongdoing that HaKadosh Baruch Hu deemed worthy of singling out as a scapegoat for visiting death upon them. As the commentaries all acknowledge, hitting the rock barely seems a punishable offense; yet it is enough to trigger the punishment that has been held at bay for nearly 40 years: Mei Merivah is the visitation of death upon Moshe and Aharon for their having gazed at G-d on Har Sinai.**^[224]{.underline}^**

It follows that the fundamental difference between the first time Moshe hit the rock at Masa U'Merivah and this time at Mei Merivah has nothing to do with the incidents themselves but rather when they took place. Masa U'Merivah occurred before Har Sinai, and as such Moshe's behavior did not warrant any response since hitting the rock was not a black-and-white sin. By the time Mei Merivah rolls around nearly 40 years later, everything has changed: in a post-Har Sinai world Moshe is on thin ice: one small misstep does have major consequences.

There is a strong thematic current that runs throughout Moshe's life in regards to his relationship with water. His very name is derived from the fact that he was drawn from water, indicating that water is intertwined with his very essence. He was protected by the waters of the Nile as a baby, forbidden from striking the waters to initiate the first plague,**^[225]{.underline}^** split the sea in order to lead Bnai Yisrael to redemption, and provided water to the people at Masa U'Merivah. The role water played in sealing Moshe's doom is thematically significant in this regard,**^[226]{.underline}^** but it serves an additional function in the context of it being the conduit for visiting the punishment of Har Sinai on Moshe and Aharon. The reason Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders were consumed by fire was because they consumed inappropriately during their transcendent experience: just as they ate on Har Sinai, so too *middah keneged middah* the fire that went out from before HaKadosh Baruch Hu ate them in the Mishkan and at Tav'eira. If Moshe and Aharon were a part of that group and similarly consumed that which should have been forbidden to them, it also follows that they should be punished in a way that reflects their initial sin: they drank in a way that was not respectful, and so as penance they were finally brought down through disrespectful drinking at Mei Merivah.**^[227]{.underline}^**

Moshe, like Nadav, Avihu and the elders, was beloved before HaKadosh Baruch Hu, and the midrash describes his death as tragic before G-d,**^[228]{.underline}^** something necessary for inscrutable reasons but nonetheless difficult and heartbreaking. Although Moshe and Aharon outlasted the rest of the nobles, in the end they too were unable to *"see G-d and live"*.**^[229]{.underline}^**

**[Slow to Anger]{.underline}**

One problem with this approach is that it fails to account for the other instances recorded in the Torah where Moshe gets upset or acts in a way that should have triggered the bomb, particularly everything that transpired during the episode with Korach. While explanations can be given for why Moshe was blameless throughout, it may also be helpful to take a different tack, namely that while HaKadosh Baruch Hu did not extend His mercy a second time for Nadav, Avihu and the elders, He did postpone judgment on Moshe and Aharon until their infraction in the fortieth year. The irony of this approach is that Moshe is commonly depicted as the paradigmatic, quintessential man of truth, yet he himself benefitted from Divine patience and slowness to anger throughout nearly his entire leadership.

As the man of truth, Moshe had trouble early on with a more compassionate depiction of G-d:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
א"ר יצחק על הכל הודה משה חוץ מדבר אחד, אמר משה לפני הקב״ה רבון העולמים חוטא אדם לפניך ואת מאריך לו, מיד הוי גובה ממנו, אמר לו הקב״ה חייך שתצרך לה. והיכן צרך לה, במרגלים, י"י ארך אפים (במדבר יד:יח):**^[230]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rabbi Yitzchak said, Moshe admitted to everything except one. Moshe said before HaKadosh Baruch Hu, Master of the Universe, a man sins before You and You extend compassion towards him - instead should you not immediately exact punishment from him? HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to him, by your life you yourself shall need this attribute of Mine. When did he need it? In regards to the spies as it says: 'Hashem, slow to anger' (Bemidbar 14:18)."**^[230]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Moshe cannot understand why the sinner should not get punished. Despite being 80 years old and having changed since the days of impassioned zealtory of his youth, Moshe still adamantly believes in truth as the dominant force which should govern the world. However, as HaKadosh Baruch Hu teaches him, in order for the world to last the attributes that dictate how the world is judged must be a blend of peace and truth, of compassion and justice, of mercy and lawfulness. Indeed, this is an important ethical theme that comes up throughout aggadic literature: only through embracing contradictions and nuance can the world survive. Moshe's approach is not sustainable, his leadership cannot be so black-and-white; Bnai Yisrael need the balance as well, or else they would not be able to survive. Fascinatingly, in the Torah itself there are multiple instances of G-d wanting to destroy Bnai Yisrael for their sins, only for Moshe to come to their defense and argue from a standpoint of compassion, and avert the decree. This midrash, however, seems to reverse those roles: it is Moshe who cannot understand the value and fairness of forgiveness, and it is HaKadosh Baruch Hu who teaches him that the world needs both in order to last.**^[231]{.underline}^**

Moshe learned why it is critical for HaKadosh Baruch Hu to temper truth with mercy, for when the nation sinned it was Moshe who needed to rush to their defense, begging for mercy on behalf of his people. While it may rub the wrong way and could be problematic if misapplied, being able to placate G-d and bend the truth to engender forgiveness is the only way all except the most righteous could survive. While this midrash sees Moshe learning this lesson via his need to ask forgiveness after the sin of the spies, there is perhaps an even stronger example of Moshe coming to the realization why truth alone cannot work: he himself needed a tempering of truth with mercy after what happened at Har Sinai.

This is because according to the strict definition of justice G-d should - and sometimes does - judge His righteous ones over a hair's breadth:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: מַעֲשֶׂה בְּבִתּוֹ שֶׁל נְחוּנְיָא חוֹפֵר שִׁיחִין שֶׁנָּפְלָה לְבוֹר הַגָּדוֹל, וּבָאוּ וְהוֹדִיעוּ לְרַבִּי חֲנִינָא בֶּן דּוֹסָא. שָׁעָה רִאשׁוֹנָה, אָמַר לָהֶם: שָׁלוֹם. שְׁנִיָּה, אָמַר לָהֶם: שָׁלוֹם. שְׁלִישִׁית, אָמַר לָהֶם: עָלְתָה. אָמַר לָהּ: בִּתִּי, מִי הֶעֱלֵךְ? אָמְרָה לוֹ: זָכָר שֶׁל רְחֵלִים נִזְדַּמֵּן לִי, וְזָקֵן מַנְהִיגוֹ. אָמְרוּ לוֹ: נָבִיא אַתָּה? אָמַר לָהֶם: ״לֹא נָבִיא אָנֹכִי וְלֹא בֶּן נָבִיא אָנֹכִי״ (תהלים נ, ג), אֶלָּא: דָּבָר שֶׁהַצַּדִּיק מִתְעַסֵּק בּוֹ יִכָּשֵׁל בּוֹ זַרְעוֹ? אָמַר רַבִּי אַבָּא: אַף עַל פִּי כֵן מֵת בְּנוֹ בַּצָּמָא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וּסְבִיבָיו נִשְׂעֲרָה מְאֹד״, מְלַמֵּד שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מְדַקְדֵּק עִם סְבִיבָיו כְּחוּט הַשַּׂעֲרָה. רַבִּי חֲנִינָא אָמַר, מֵהָכָא: ״אֵל נַעֲרָץ בְּסוֹד קְדוֹשִׁים רַבָּה וְנוֹרָא עַל כׇּל סְבִיבָיו״ (תהלים פט, ח):**^[232]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"The Rabbis taught, there was a story with the daughter of Nehunyah the well digger who fell into a big cistern, and they came and told Rabbi Haninah Ben Dosa. The first hour he told them, she is at peace. The second hour he told them, she is at peace. The third hour he told them, she has come out unharmed. He said to her, my daughter, who raised you up? She said to him, a male sheep passed by me and sensed me there, and an old man was leading him and he pulled me out. They said to Rabbi Haninah, are you a prophet? He said to them: 'I am not a prophet nor the son of a prophet' (Amos 7:14); rather, the work a tzaddik does, is it possible that his offspring would be harmed from it? Rabbi Abba said, even so his son died from thirst despite him being a righteous well digger, as it says: 'Around Him it storms mightily' (Tehillim 50:3) - this teaches that HaKadosh Baruch Hu is extremely strict with those around Him i.e. tzaddikim to a hair's breadth. Rabbi Haninah said, derive it from there: 'A G-d dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by those around Him' (Tehillim 89:8)."**^[232]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

This concept, if applied to Moshe and Aharon, would have had them deserving to meet the same fate as Nadav, Avihu and the seventy elders at the slightest infraction. The fact that they both survived the entire 40 years of wandering in the desert, including experiences such as Korach's rebellion, is a testament to the fact that HaKadosh Baruch Hu treated them with mercy and overrode His strict judgment. Even when they were finally condemned, it was not an immediate sentence, but rather one that gave them time to fulfill their respective missions and pass on the mantles of leadership to the next generation of leaders. Moshe himself was therefore a beneficiary of the very 'slow to anger' quality he was so unable to understand and accept; he and Aharon were allowed to continue living and get their affairs in order despite justice demanding otherwise. At the same time, of course, Moshe's pleas to enter into Eretz Yisrael fell on deaf ears, demonstrating that HaKadosh Baruch Hu governs His world with both attributes, and that the proper approach is a healthy acceptance of the tension between these two.

**[Accepting Judgment]{.underline}**

Did Moshe ever come to terms with being forbidden from entering Eretz Yisrael? Or was he unable to accept this decree from Above to his dying day? From the pesukim themselves it is difficult to gauge Moshe's personal feelings, for he does not react when Hashem initially conveys the bad news. While in his parting words to Bnai Yisrael he relays how his attempts to overturn the decree fell on deaf ears, we still don't get a clear indication of whether he went to his grave at peace with what happened.

Before we turn to aggadah to help shed light on this, we must first ask a related question: how does this actually work - what is the mechanism for determining the equivalent level of sin a minor sin done by a *tzaddik* is "worth"? One midrash, explaining what happened to Moshe and Aharon at Mei Merivah, tells us that the sin is "increased" in its severity so that it is considered as if many sins were committed by a regular person:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
כי אותו החטא לא היה גדול והשי״ת הגדיל עונם לרוב גדולתם כמי שחטאיו ספורים, וכמו שאמרו רז״ל וסביביו נשערה מאד, מלמד שהקב״ה מדקדק עם הצדיקים כחוט השערה, ורבים יגעו והאריכו להוציא לאור טעם החטא הזה והעלו בידם חרס ולא יכלו לבארו על נכון. י״א כי השי״ת צוה להם ודברתם והם לא דברו אלא משה הכהו פעמים וע״כ נענשו וכו:**^[233]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"That sin at Mei Merivah was not so great, yet Hashem Yitbarach increased their sin in how it was reckoned due to their greatness to be like someone whose sins were great, as the Rabbis said: 'His surroundings storm mightily' - this teaches that HaKadosh Baruch Hu is extremely strict with His tzaddikim to a hair's breadth. Many have put in effort and waxed on in order to reveal the reason for this sin, but nothing more than earth came from it and they could not explain it satisfactorily. For example there are those that say Hashem Yitbarach commanded them to speak, but they did not speak and instead Moshe struck it twice, and because of that they were punished, etc."**^[233]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The Talmud also explicitly uses a similar argument to justify why the punishment of Moshe and Aharon was so harsh, and Rashi relates the concept of judging *tzaddikim* "by a hair's breadth" with the idea that "according to the camel is the burden"; that is, because *tzaddikim* have faith and belief in Providence they are able to handle more suffering even if it is not in line with the level of sin incurred.**^[234]{.underline}^**

To get a sense of which hints from the pesukim the midrash picks up on to inform its approach to this question, it is worth visiting a story related to a great *tzaddik* who is also punished in a way not commensurate with his crime due to G-d judging His close ones by a hair's breadth:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אתיוהו לרבי חנינא בן תרדיון אמרו ליה אמאי קא עסקת באורייתא אמר להו כאשר צוני ה׳ א-לקי מיד גזרו עליו לשריפה ועל אשתו להריגה ועל בתו לישב בקובה של זונות עליו לשריפה שהיה הוגה את השם באותיותיו והיכי עביד הכי והתנן אלו שאין להם חלק לעולם הבא האומר אין תורה מן השמים ואין תחיית המתים מן התורה אבא שאול אומר אף ההוגה את השם באותיותיו להתלמד עבד כדתניא (דברים יח, ט) לא תלמד לעשות אבל אתה למד להבין ולהורות אלא מאי טעמא אענש משום הוגה את השם בפרהסיא דהוי ועל אשתו להריגה דלא מיחה ביה מכאן אמרו כל מי שיש בידו למחות ואינו מוחה נענש עליו ועל בתו לישב בקובה של זונות דאמר ר' יוחנן פעם אחת היתה בתו מהלכת לפני גדולי רומי אמרו כמה נאות פסיעותיה של ריבה זו מיד דקדקה בפסיעותיה והיינו דאמר ר' שמעון בן לקיש מאי דכתיב (תהלים מט, ו) עון עקבי יסבני עונות שאדם דש בעקביו בעולם הזה מסובין לו ליום הדין בשעה שיצאו שלשתן צדקו עליהם את הדין הוא אמר (דברים לב, ד) הצור תמים פעלו וגו' ואשתו אמרה (דברים לב, ד) אל אמונה ואין עול בתו אמרה (ירמיהו לב, יט) גדול העצה ורב העליליה אשר עיניך פקוחות על כל דרכי וגו' אמר רבי כמה גדולים צדיקים הללו שנזדמנו להן שלש מקראות של צדוק הדין בשעת צדוק הדין:**^[235]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"They came before Rabbi Haninah Ben Teradyon and said to him, why are you learning Torah? He said to them: 'As Hashem My G-'d has commanded me'. They immediately condemned him to death by burning, and his wife to death by sword, and his daughter to live out her days in a harlot's house. He was punished with death by burning because he used to pronounce the Holy Name with its letters. But did he do this - was it not taught, these are the ones who have no share in Olam HaBa: whoever says Torah did not come from Heaven, and that there is no resurrection of the dead from the Torah. Abba Shaul says, even one who pronounces the Holy Name with its letters? Rabbi Haninah did it in order to teach himself, as it says: 'You shall not learn to do' (Devarim 18:9), but you may learn to understand and teach. So why was he punished? Because he pronounced the name in public. His wife was punished with death by sword because she did not stop him. From here they said, whoever has the ability to stop someone from sinning and does not is punished for it. His daughter was punished to live in a harlot's house, as Rabbi Yochanan said, one time his daughter was walking before the great men of Rome and they said, how nice are her steps; she immediately was precise in her steps to keep their attention. This is as Reish Lakish said, why does it say: 'The iniquity of my heel encircles me' (Tehillim 49:6)? This means the sins that a man tramples with his heel in this world encircle him on the day of judgment. When the three of them were taken out to be killed, they accepted the justice of HaKadosh Baruch Hu's judgment. Rabbi Haninah said: 'The Rock, His works are perfect' (Devarim 32:4). His wife said: 'He is a G-d of faith and there is no wrongdoing' (Devarim 32:4). His daughter said: 'Great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways' (Yirmiyahu 32:19). Rabbi said, how great were these tzaddikim, that they were able to conjure up three pesukim about accepting judgment in a time of accepting judgment."**^[235]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Rabbi Chaninah and his family received terrible punishments for sins that seem minor at best. While they accept their fates - a fact that Rabbi in wonder marvels at - the question remains: where is the justice in how they were sentenced?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
ומיהו הקב"ה מדקדק עם הצדיקים כחוט השערה (יבמות דף קכא:) ואפילו להתלמד יש לחוש לכבוד הרב:**^[236]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Despite the fact that Rabbi Haninah pronounced the Holy Name with letters in order to teach himself, HaKadosh Baruch Hu is extremely strict with His tzaddikim like a hair's breadth (Yevamot 121b), so even if it is merely to teach himself there is reason to be cognizant of the Master's honor."**^[236]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

According to Rashi, the reason Rabbi Haninah was punished so severely for such a minor infraction is that G-d is extremely strict with His tzaddikim. We see a parallel between the punishment of Moshe and Aharon on the one hand, and that of Rabbi Haninah and his family on the other: both are described as having committed minor crimes, yet because they were righteous they could bear the burden of a harsher judgment.

There is a deeper parallel present here as well. Moshe has a record of pronouncing the Holy Name in a questionable way**^[237]{.underline}^** going back as early as his teenage years**^[238]{.underline}^** until his dying day:

"What does 'Before his death' (Devarim 33:1) mean? The Rabbis said, what did Moshe do? He grabbed the Angel of Death and threw him down before him, and blessed the tribes, each one according to his blessing. Rabbi Meir said, the Angel of Death went to Moshe and said to him, HaKadosh Baruch Hu sent me to you, for you are going to die today. Moshe said to him, leave here for I am trying to praise HaKadosh Baruch Hu, as it says: 'I shall not die, for I shall live, and I shall tell the deeds of Yah' (Tehillim 118:17). He said to him, Moshe, why are you proud? He has others to praise Him; the heavens and earth praise him every hour, as it says: 'The heavens tell the glory of E-l' (Tehillim 19:2). Moshe said to him, I shall silence them and praise Him, as it says: 'Listen heavens and I shall speak' (Devarim 32:1). The Angel of Death came to Moshe a second time. What did Moshe do? He pronounced the Holy Name and fled, as it says: 'For I shall pronounce the Name of Hashem' (Devarim 32:3). When the Angel of Death came to Moshe a third time, he said, since this is from Hashem, I need to accept this judgment, as it says: 'The Rock, His ways are perfect' (Devarim 32:4)."**^[239]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is a beautiful symmetry and closure found the in midrashim here: Moshe uses the Holy Name at the beginning of his life to save a Hebrew by killing the Egyptian, and he uses it at the end of his life to save his own life by escaping the sword of the Angel of Death. Both usages, while well intentioned and justifiable in some sense, backfire: the son of that Egyptian who Moshe killed ends up blaspheming with the Holy Name,**^[240]{.underline}^** and Moshe's usage of the Holy Name to attempt escape from the Angel of Death was done in vain.

These nuanced examples from Moshe's life of the Holy Name being pronounced with desire to help and save only to lead to death and irrelevance relate to Rabbi Haninah's sin of pronouncing the Holy Name, and specifically of pronouncing it in public. This parallels the sin of Moshe and Aharon, since HaKadosh Baruch Hu reprimands them for not sanctifying Him in the "eyes of Bnai Yisrael", in public; they too sinned through behavior that was not unacceptable in private, but unbecoming of *tzaddikim* in public.

After repeated attempts to avoid dying, including an unsuccessful flight from the Angel of Death, Moshe finally accepts that it is the Divine will for him to die and not enter Eretz Yisrael. He proclaims the pasuk from the Song of Ha'azinu: *"The Rock, His ways are perfect" (Devarim 32:4)*, the ultimate example of *tzidduk hadin*.**^[241]{.underline}^** This very pasuk uttered by Moshe as he accepted the Angel of Death is the same one declared by Rabbi Haninah as he was led to his death as well.**^[242]{.underline}^**

Just as Rabbi Haninah's sin and *tzidduk hadin* parallel those of Moshe, so do the sins of Aharon and Rabbi Haninah's wife, who was punished for not stopping her husband from his behavior:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אהרן מה חטא מכאן שהמטפל לעובר עבירה כעובר עבירה והיה אהרן יכול לומר אני לא חטאתי אלא שתק וכבש כחו ולא למד על עצמו סניגוריא ומשה מקלסו שנאמר האומר לאביו ולאמו לא ראיתיו לא עמד לומר עשה בשביל אבא בשביל אמא שלא תכנס שכולה בג' בניה. ואת אחיו לא הכיר שלא היה לו עסק עם אחיו בשמעו נא המורים. ואת בניו לא ידע כשנשרפו בניו ושתק:**^[243]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"What was Aharon's sin? From here that he who aids a sinner, is considered as if he were a sinner himself Aharon could have said, I did nothing wrong, but instead he was silent and restrained his strength and did not try to vindicate himself. For this Moshe praised him, as it says in the blessings to the tribe of Levi: 'He who says to his father and mother, I have not seen' - he did not stand to say it was done because of father or mother, so that she should not lose her three sons. 'He does not recognize his brother' - that he did not act with Moshe at Mei Merivah. 'He does not know his sons' - because they were burned, and yet he was silent."**^[243]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Many of the commentaries are even more troubled by the fact that Aharon is punished than that his brother was; although it is difficult to understand what Moshe did that was so terrible, Aharon did not do anything at all. Yet it is precisely this inaction, this passivity, that made him complicit in the actions of Moshe, for he could have interceded and the outcome could have been completely different.**^[244]{.underline}^** Rabbi Haninah's wife is similarly punished, not for any actions of her own, but simply for not objecting to her husband's behavior.**^[245]{.underline}^**

When all is said and done, the theophanic revelation of Shmot 24, far from being an isolated vision of mystical import with no relevance beyond the time and place it was received, had ripple effects and consequences that were felt, not just in the months following the revelation, being during the entire 40 year journey of Bnai Yisrael in the desert. The deaths of Aharon and Moshe at the border of Eretz Yisrael demonstrated that man cannot "see G-d and live", no matter how great or small; even someone on the level of Moshe Rabbeinu was destined to die as a result, his fate changed irrevocably. The message, reiterated over and over again in the Torah and brought down in midrashim and stories such as that of Rabbi Haninah Ben Teryadon, is a sobering one: HaKadosh Baruch storms mightily, and while the world is governed with a blend of mercy and judgment, we cannot become complacent and rely on forgiveness, for the greatest among us were doomed for sins we cannot fathom being held accountable for. Instead, we are encouraged to be silent, live humbly and accept an often-inscrutable Divine justice, and to learn from Moshe himself, who after a long struggle finally acquiesces: *"The Rock, His ways are perfect."*

"Hashem said to Moshe and Aharon at Hor HaHar, at the border of the land of Edom, as follows: Aharon shall be gathered unto his people, for he shall not come to the land which I have given to Bnai Yisrael, because you both rebelled against My word at Mei Merivah. Take Aharon and his son Elazar, and bring them up to Hor HaHar. Strip Aharon of his clothes, and dress his son Elazar in them; then Aharon shall be gathered in and die there. Moshe did as Hashem commanded, and they ascended Hor HaHar before the entire congregation. Moshe stripped Aharon of his clothes, and dressed his son Elazar in them. Aharon died there at the top of the mountain, and Moshe and Elazar came down from the mountain. The whole congregation saw that Aharon had passed away, and the whole house of Yisrael cried for Aharon for thirty days." (Bemidbar 20: 23-29)
</div>
</div>

After many years of trials and tribulations, the moment has finally arrived: destiny awaits, impatiently itching to burst through the doorway and leave behind the unfolding Divine drama holding it at bay for four centuries. The voice of His beloved calls out: "Behold! The time for redemption has arrived."**^[246]{.underline}^** And yet, even as history reaches the actualization of a promise made many generations ago, affairs must first be put in order: Aharon and Moshe will die before the people are permitted passage into Eretz Canaan.

Jews have wrestled with the story of *Mei Merivah* for thousands of years, and it remains as obstinate as ever in its inscrutability. Yet the shadow of Moshe and Aharons' punishment looms so large that it often obscures an important detail of that punishment which deserves an additional level of scrutiny. For Moshe is not merely prohibited from experiencing firsthand the flowering of his life's mission; he must accompany his brother Aharon to his death at HaKadosh Barch Hu's command**^[247]{.underline}^**, and inaugurate his nephew Elazar with the enormous responsibilities of *Kohen Gadol*.

Several questions arise while reading these pesukim. Why did Moshe have to personally witness and endure such a heart-wrenching experience? Surely the burial could have taken place without Moshe's presence.**^[248]{.underline}^** Furthermore, there is a difference in the implication of dying outside of Eretz Canaan for Moshe and Aharon: Moshe's children did not follow in his footsteps, and as such his death signifies the end of his leadership, while Aharon's death as simply the first of many *Kohanei Gadol* is merely the beginning of his. Why would HaKadosh Baruch Hu insist on Moshe overseeing the successful passage of Aharon's mantle to his offspring, something Moshe himself was unable to do? And finally, we are told that Moshe faithfully does as he is commanded**^[249]{.underline}^**, but the pesukim are silent otherwise. Surely administering to Aharon's death and staring his older brother's legacy in the face, all while grappling with the knowledge of his own imminent demise, should provoke some kind of reaction. How did Moshe feel while carrying out HaKadosh Baruch Hu's Divine command?**^[250]{.underline}^**

One way to interpret Moshe's role in the Hor HaHar ceremony is to argue that his presence was needed for technical reasons: Aharon could not formally have the role of *Kohen Gadol* divested from him unless it was done by the deputy *Kohen Gadol*, namely Moshe**^[251]{.underline}^**.
Alternatively, Moshe's purpose was to provide comfort to Aharon, who would naturally compare his life to his brother's and take solace in how blessed he is to have children that will wear his crown**^[252]{.underline}^**.

Another school of midrashic thought is bothered by the conspicuous absence of a reaction on the part of Moshe. There are various accounts of Moshe's emotional turmoil, some elaborating more than others on the depths of his anguish and despair at losing his brother and having to be the one to bear the terrible news. This is especially true of the later aggadic works, where this theme gets particularly extensive treatment. Such traditions poignantly describing Moshe bursting into tears, consumed by anguish at having to carry such a heavy burden, and at him now being all alone without family to bury or honor him.

These later midrashim all have a common thread running through them - that of Moshe being overwhelmed with emotion at the death of Aharon - yet they each present that reaction at different points throughout the narrative. Midrash Petirat Aharon**^[253]{.underline}^** describes Moshe as breaking down immediately after receiving the command from G-d to accompany Aharon up the mountain; Yalkut Shimoni**^[254]{.underline}^** records it once Moshe sees Aharon's death and the honor he was afforded; and Targum Yerushalmi**^[255]{.underline}^** has Moshe publicly displaying signs of mourning upon his descent from the mountain.

It is possible that each of these traditions has a slightly different focus in mind which motivates their chronological placement of Moshe's distress. For Midrash Petirat Aharon, Moshe's reaction is *visceral* - the news immediately triggers an intense emotional response. For Yalkut Shimoni, Moshe's reaction is *visual* - it is only upon seeing Aharon's bier that Moshe truly internalizes the horror of what has transpired, refusing to accept it beforehand even if he knew that G-d's decree would inevitably come to pass. And for Targum Yerushalmi, Moshe's mourning is on full display before the people, portraying Moshe's mourning less in a deeply personal and psychological light and more as a public show of leadership and meeting the communal expectation.

After 40 years of leadership, Moshe well understood the challenge inherent in navigating his personal desires while anticipating what was best for Bnai Yisrael. By inferring that Moshe showed a public display of mourning - which then led the people to cry over Aharon on their own accord - Targum Yerushalmi reveals to us a brilliant calculation on Moshe's part. Moshe knew from previous experience that the people were inclined not to believe in something that they couldn't see with their own eyes. He therefore needed a way to demonstrate that Aharon had died while not provoking the ire of those among the people who were bound to rise against him. Perhaps Moshe reasoned as follows: if I do not show any public display of mourning and only remember Aharon privately, the people will suspect that I had a hand in his death, which will lead to their hating me and not giving Aharon the respect he deserves. If, however, I demand from them to mourn him - as is customary when a national leader passes away - that too may raise their ire against me. The least dangerous course of action left to me is that I will myself show the people how distraught I am over his death, and pray that my genuine display will move them to grieve Aharon's death as well.

Yet another midrashic line of inquiry is focused on sharpening the reaction of Bnai Yisrael to Aharon's death, and it describes Moshe publicly mourning with rent garments and covered in ashes. This explanation - namely, that Moshe acted as an eyewitness - also aims to address a linguistic difficulty. The Torah informs us that *"the entire congregation saw that Aharon had died" (Bemidbar 20:29)*, yet how can they have seen Aharon had died if his burial had occurred in a cave on top of the mountain? According to this approach the people did not "see" in the physical sense that Aharon had died but rather understood it intellectually: Aharon had gone up with Moshe and Elazar but not come back down, and Moshe was distraught and publicly showing signs of grief and mourning; the nation believed Moshe's show of anguish and did not question Aharon had died.**^[256]{.underline}^** Other midrashim, however, do interpret "see" here in the literal sense and argue instead that the people did not believe Moshe's show of grief, accusing him of having ulterior motives instead, even perhaps having Aharon killed over a personal matter. HaKadosh Baruch Hu had to perform a miracle and suspend Aharon's coffin in the air above the people to dispel any further doubts, and it was only then, with Aharon's dead corpse staring them in the face, were the people able to accept that he was truly dead.**^[257]{.underline}^**

In order to gain a fuller appreciation of the context surrounding Moshe and Aharon at Hor HaHar, it behooves us to investigate the complexity of Moshe's relationship with the rest of his immediate family, namely: his children Gershom and Eliezer, his wife Tzipporah, and his sister Miriam.**^[258]{.underline}^** Those relationships - each of which were fraught with challenges - will act as a foil for Moshe's bond with Aharon. We will rely on various aggadic approaches and insights to guide us along the way.



**Part 1: Gershom & Eliezer**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Moshe's desperate plea at Hor HaHar conveys a sense of ultimate despair at having no family left to care for him at death:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אני מה תהא עלי מי יעמוד עלי בשעת מיתה לא אב ולא בן ולא אח ולא אחות מי יבכה עלי:**^[253]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"What will be for me, who will stand over me at the hour of death? I don't have a father or a son or a brother or a sister left - who will cry over me?"**^[253]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Most of this declaration is factually correct beyond any shadow of a doubt. We are told that Moshe's father Amram was 137 years old when he passed away**^[259]{.underline}^**, Miriam had already died before Bnai Yisrael reached Hor HaHar, and other than Aharon and Miriam Moshe had no other siblings. But why is Moshe lamenting that he does not have a son? After all, not one but two sons were born to Moshe:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיִּשְׁמַ֞ע יִתְר֨וֹ כֹהֵ֤ן מִדְיָן֙ חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֵת֩ כׇּל אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ לְמֹשֶׁ֔ה וּלְיִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַמּ֑וֹ כִּֽי הוֹצִ֧יא יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃ וַיִּקַּ֗ח יִתְרוֹ֙ חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֶת צִפֹּרָ֖ה אֵ֣שֶׁת מֹשֶׁ֑ה אַחַ֖ר שִׁלּוּחֶֽיהָ׃ וְאֵ֖ת שְׁנֵ֣י בָנֶ֑יהָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר שֵׁ֤ם הָֽאֶחָד֙ גֵּֽרְשֹׁ֔ם כִּ֣י אָמַ֔ר גֵּ֣ר הָיִ֔יתִי בְּאֶ֖רֶץ נׇכְרִיָּֽה׃ וְשֵׁ֥ם הָאֶחָ֖ד אֱלִיעֶ֑זֶר כִּֽי אֱלֹהֵ֤י אָבִי֙ בְּעֶזְרִ֔י וַיַּצִּלֵ֖נִי מֵחֶ֥רֶב פַּרְעֹֽה׃**^[260]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Yitro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moshe, heard about what G-d did for Moshe and His nation Yisrael, that Hashem took Yisrael out of Mitzrayim. Yitro, the father-in-law of Moshe, took Tzipporah, Moshe's wife, after she had been sent away. And her two sons: One was named Gershom, for Moshe said 'I was a stranger in a foreign land', and the other was named Eliezer, for 'the G-d of my father assisted me and saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.'"**^[260]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The Torah is laconic in its treatment of Moshe's children, and this brief description is the last time Gershom and Eliezer are mentioned. We know they do not merit to inherit the mantle of their illustrious father, for it is Yehoshua who leads the people into Eretz Canaan. Why are Gershom and Eliezer not considered as Moshe contemplates the future leadership of Bnai Yisrael? Did Moshe perhaps desire one of them to take over after his death?

The midrash is troubled by this question and notes an interesting juxtaposition between the story of Tzelophchad's daughters and the appointment of Yehoshua as Moshe's successor:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
יִפְקֹד ה'. מָה רָאָה לְבַקֵּשׁ הַצֹּרֶךְ הַזֶּה אַחַר סֵדֶר נַחֲלוֹת. אֶלָּא כֵּיוָן שֶׁיָּרְשׁוּ בְּנוֹת צְלָפְחָד בְּנִכְסֵי אֲבִיהֶם, אָמַר מֹשֶׁה, הֲרֵי הַשָּׁעָה שֶׁאֶתְבַּע צְרָכַי. אִם הַבָּנוֹת יוֹרְשׁוֹת, בְּדִין הוּא שֶׁיִּירְשׁוּ בָּנַי אֶת כְּבוֹדִי. אָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לְמֹשֶׁה, נוֹצֵר תְּאֵנָה יֹאכַל פִּרְיָהּ (משלי כז, יח). בָּנֶיךָ, יָשְׁבוּ לָהֶם וְלֹא עָסְקוּ בַּתּוֹרָה. יְהוֹשֻׁעַ שֶׁשִּׁמֶּשְׁךָ כְּדַאי הוּא שֶׁיְּשַׁמֵּשׁ אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל, שֶׁאֵינוֹ מְאַבֵּד אֶת שְׂכָרוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: קַח לְךָ אֶת יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בִּן נוּן:**^[261]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'May Hashem appoint a leader over the people' (Bemidbar 27:16). Why did Moshe request this after the laws of inheritance? Because once he saw that the daughters of Tzelophchad would inherit the possessions of their father, Moshe said: This is the time to plead my case. If the daughters inherit, then surely my sons should inherit my honor and assume the mantle of leadership. HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'He who tends to his fig tree will eat its fruit' (Mishlei 27:18). Your sons sat idly and did not learn Torah. Yehoshua who served you - it is proper that he should serve Yisrael as their leader so that his reward does not get lost, as it says: 'Take Yehoshua Bin Nun' (Bemidbar 27:18)."**^[261]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Moshe desperately wanted his sons to carry on his legacy and lead Bnai Yisrael after his death. He saw in the Divine ruling permitting daughters without brothers to inherit their fathers' land a precedent, an opportunity to audaciously ask HaKadosh Baruch Hu to similarly ensure his dynastic continuity. To Moshe's dismay, however, HaKadosh Baruch Hu refuses, explaining that his position of national leadership cannot be compared to the question of estate inheritance. There is a crucial difference between property - which passes through the generations as determined by the laws of filial succession - and spiritual greatness: in order to inherit that title, a person's children must continue in his footsteps. Gershom and Eliezer, claims the midrash, had strayed from a Torah observant path, but the midrash goes one step further: just as a tree which was not well tended will not bear fruit, so too the blame for Moshe's children not being involved in Torah lies squarely at his own feet. What led the midrash to conclude that Moshe - the greatest prophet who ever lived - had not done enough to *"tend to his fruit"*?

**[Divine Encounter]{.underline}**

To understand this, one needs to look at the first references made to Moshe's sons. After the episode of the burning bush, Shmot Perek 4 describes how HaKadosh Baruch Hu commands Moshe to leave Midian and return to Egypt, assuring him that the royal death sentence which had originally caused him to flee was no longer of any concern. After asking for and receiving permission from his father-in-law to leave Midian, Moshe takes his wife and two children and begins the arduous journey. Along the way they stop at a hotel, where they experience the following bizarre encounter:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֶל מֹשֶׁה֙ בְּמִדְיָ֔ן לֵ֖ךְ שֻׁ֣ב מִצְרָ֑יִם כִּי מֵ֙תוּ֙ כׇּל הָ֣אֲנָשִׁ֔ים הַֽמְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃ וַיִּקַּ֨ח מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶת אִשְׁתּ֣וֹ וְאֶת בָּנָ֗יו וַיַּרְכִּבֵם֙ עַֽל הַחֲמֹ֔ר וַיָּ֖שׇׁב אַ֣רְצָה מִצְרָ֑יִם וַיִּקַּ֥ח מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת מַטֵּ֥ה הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים בְּיָדֽוֹ׃ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָה֮ אֶל מֹשֶׁה֒ בְּלֶכְתְּךָ֙ לָשׁ֣וּב מִצְרַ֔יְמָה רְאֵ֗ה כׇּל הַמֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְיָדֶ֔ךָ וַעֲשִׂיתָ֖ם לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וַאֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת לִבּ֔וֹ וְלֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת הָעָֽם׃ וְאָמַרְתָּ֖ אֶל פַּרְעֹ֑ה כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּנִ֥י בְכֹרִ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ וָאֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗יךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת בְּנִי֙ וְיַֽעַבְדֵ֔נִי וַתְּמָאֵ֖ן לְשַׁלְּח֑וֹ הִנֵּה֙ אָנֹכִ֣י הֹרֵ֔ג אֶת בִּנְךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽךָ׃ וַיְהִ֥י בַדֶּ֖רֶךְ בַּמָּל֑וֹן וַיִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣הוּ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַיְבַקֵּ֖שׁ הֲמִיתֽוֹ׃ וַתִּקַּ֨ח צִפֹּרָ֜ה צֹ֗ר וַתִּכְרֹת֙ אֶת עׇרְלַ֣ת בְּנָ֔הּ וַתַּגַּ֖ע לְרַגְלָ֑יו וַתֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֧י חֲתַן דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽי׃ וַיִּ֖רֶף מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אָ֚ז אָֽמְרָ֔ה חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַמּוּלֹֽת׃ וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶֽל אַהֲרֹ֔ן לֵ֛ךְ לִקְרַ֥את מֹשֶׁ֖ה הַמִּדְבָּ֑רָה וַיֵּ֗לֶךְ וַֽיִּפְגְּשֵׁ֛הוּ בְּהַ֥ר הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים וַיִּשַּׁק לֽוֹ׃ וַיַּגֵּ֤ד מֹשֶׁה֙ לְאַֽהֲרֹ֔ן אֵ֛ת כׇּל דִּבְרֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר שְׁלָח֑וֹ וְאֵ֥ת כׇּל הָאֹתֹ֖ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּֽהוּ׃**^[262]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Hashem said to Moshe in Midian: Return to Egypt, for all the people seeking your life are dead. Moshe took his wife and sons, mounted them on the donkey, and headed towards Egypt. Moshe also took the staff of G-d in his hand. Hashem said to Moshe: When you journey to return to Egypt see all of the miracles that I have placed in your hand and do them before Pharaoh. I will strengthen his heart and he will not send the nation free. Then you will say to Pharaoh: Thus says Hashem: Yisrael is my firstborn son. And I say to you: Send my son free so that he may worship me, for if you refuse to send him I shall kill your firstborn son. And it was on the way at the hotel that Hashem met him and sought to kill him. Tzipporah took a rock and cut off the foreskin of her son, touched his feet, and said: You are a bridegroom of blood to me. He left him alone, and then she said: A bridegroom of blood because of the circumcision. Hashem said to Aharon: Go meet Moshe in the desert. He went and met Moshe at the mountain of G-d and kissed him. Moshe told Aharon all the words that Hashem had committed to him, and all the signs that he had commanded him."**^[262]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Many aspects of this esoteric episode cry out for midrashic explanation. We are told that Moshe is traveling with Tzipporah and both of their sons, but which of the two boys was circumcised? Who did Hashem seek to kill? Was it Hashem Himself, or one of His holy emissaries? Whose foot did Tzipporah touch with the removed foreskin, and why? How did Tzipporah know that *brit milah* was the magic antidote to the danger her family was in? And does any of this have to do with the larger redemptive nature of their trip?

The Talmud sees in this story a proof text that highlights the importance of *brit milah*, as that is the only way to plausibly make sense of why Moshe's family was threatened so severely:

"It was taught: Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Karcha said: Great is circumcision, because all the merits that Moshe Rabbeinu had did not help him when he was lax with circumcision, as it says: 'Hashem met him and sought to kill him' (Shmot 4:24). Rabbi said, heaven forbid that Moshe Rabbeinu was lax with circumcision. Rather, he said to himself: if I circumcise and leave, it will be dangerous, as it says: 'On the third day when they were in pain' (Breishit 34:25). If I circumcise and wait three days - HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to me: 'Go return to Egypt' (Shmot 4:19). So why was Moshe punished? Because he dealt with the lodgings first, as it says: 'And it was on the way to the hotel' (Shmot 4:24).

Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says: Satan did not seek to kill Moshe Rabbeinu but rather that baby, as it says: 'You are a bridegroom of blood to me' (Shmot 4:25). Who is called a bridegroom in this case? It must be the baby. Rabbi Yehudah Bar Bizna taught: When Moshe Rabbeinu was lax with circumcision, the angels Anger and Wrath came and swallowed him, and all that was left sticking out were his feet. Immediately 'Tzipporah took a rock and cut off her son's foreskin' (Shmot 4:25). Then: 'He left him alone' (Shmot 4:26)."**^[263]{.underline}^**^**
</div>
</div>

Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel believes that Satan sought to kill the baby because he remained uncircumcised; while Moshe was negligent in the performance of *brit milah*, he was not the target of Hashem's retributive attack. As to the question of why foreskin was touched to someone's feet, Rabbi Yehudah Bar Bizna replies that it was Moshe's feet, and not another part of his body, because the terrifying angels Anger and Wrath had swallowed Moshe whole. His feet, sticking out of their mouths, was the only visible appendage remaining.

In addition to clarifying any linguistic confusion regarding the phrase *"a bridegroom of blood"*, Rabban Shimon seems motivated by larger thematic considerations. This crisis emerged during Moshe's begrudging descent from Midian to Egypt. If HaKadosh Baruch Hu intended to kill Moshe before the latter ever arrived in Egypt to begin with, why bother forcing Moshe against his will? One could respond that while the threat against Moshe's life was very real, at the same time HaKadosh Baruch Hu knew in His infinite wisdom how the events were destined to unfold and actualize; He knew that Tzipporah would intervene, thereby saving Moshe's life and rendering this deathly Divine force impotent.**^[264]{.underline}^** Yet it remains difficult to accept that HaKadosh Baruch Hu would want to end the life of His chosen savior for an infraction such as neglecting *brit milah* even in principle, especially after dispatching him to be a conduit for Bnai Yisrael's destiny. Understanding the target of this story to be Moshe's child, instead of Moshe, avoids this entire issue.**^[265]{.underline}^**

Rabbi Yehudah is similarly concerned with thematic integrity, and uses the linguistic ambiguity of *"she touched his feet with the foreskin" (Shmot 4:25)* as a jumping off point for his explication. No explanation is given in the pesukim for why Tzipporah came to her son's rescue and not her husband. Could it be that Moshe Rabbeinu was unwilling or unable to circumcise his son, even under such harrowing circumstances? Or was he perhaps paralyzed, somehow prevented from taking action? Surely, argues Rabbi Yehudah, it must be the latter option. Being devoured whole by angels would make it difficult for any person to perform a circumcision, even someone of Moshe's stature. This approach also dramatically clarifies the question of who the original victim of Hashem's directive was,**^[266]{.underline}^** and explains why Tzipporah had no choice but to intervene.**^[267]{.underline}^**

Much like the halachic process, aggadic teachings are not static but dynamic, evolving and crystallizing as they are adapted to different circumstances and times. Oftentimes we find variants of a core aggadic teaching that appear in later works, and these variations themselves can be fascinating sources of further penetrating insight.**^[268]{.underline}^** An example of this phenomenon can be found in Shmot Rabbah, the classic midrashic commentary on Sefer Shmot. It was edited, compiled and published several hundred years after the Talmud Bavli reached completion, and it contains a fascinating twist on Rabbi Yehudah's opinion:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
חֲבִיבָה מִילָה שֶׁלֹא נִתְלָה משֶׁה עָלֶיהָ אֲפִלּוּ שָׁעָה אַחַת, לְפִיכָךְ כְּשֶׁהָיָה בַּדֶּרֶךְ וְנִתְעַסֵּק בַּמָּלוֹן וְנִתְעַצֵּל לָמוּל לֶאֱלִיעֶזֶר בְּנוֹ, מִיָּד וַיִּפְגְּשֵׁהוּ ה' וַיְבַקֵּשׁ הֲמִיתוֹ. אַתְּ מוֹצֵא מַלְאָךְ שֶׁל רַחֲמִים הָיָה וְאַף עַל פִּי כֵן וַיְבַקֵּשׁ הֲמִיתוֹ. וַתִּקַּח צִפֹּרָה צֹר, וְכִי מִנַּיִן יָדְעָה צִפּוֹרָה שֶׁעַל עִסְקֵי מִילָה נִסְתַּכֵּן משֶׁה, אֶלָּא בָּא הַמַּלְאָךְ וּבָלַע לְמשֶׁה מֵרֹאשׁוֹ וְעַד הַמִּילָה. כֵּיוָן שֶׁרָאֲתָה צִפּוֹרָה שֶׁלֹא בָּלַע אוֹתוֹ אֶלָּא עַד הַמִּילָה הִכִּירָה שֶׁעַל עִסְקֵי הַמִּילָה הוּא נִיזֹּק, וְיָדְעָה כַּמָּה גָדוֹל כֹּחַ הַמִּילָה שֶׁלֹא הָיָה יָכוֹל לְבָלְעוֹ יוֹתֵר מִכָּאן, מִיָּד וַתִּכְרֹת אֶת עָרְלַת בְּנָהּ וַתַּגַּע לְרַגְלָיו:**^[269]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Great is circumcision, that Moshe was not spared over it for even one hour. For when he was on the way and he dealt with the lodgings and was too lazy to circumcise Eliezer his son, immediately: 'Hashem met him and sought to kill him' (Shmot 4:24). You find that it was an angel of mercy and even so 'it sought to kill him.' 'Tzipporah took a rock' (Shmot 4:25). How did Tzipporah know that Moshe was in danger because of circumcision? The angel came and swallowed Moshe from his head to his own circumcision. Once Tzipporah saw that the angel could not swallow Moshe past his circumcision, she recognized that he was endangered because of the circumcision, and she knew how strong the power of circumcision is that the angel could swallow no further than it. Immediately: 'She cut the foreskin of her son and touched his feet.'"**^[269]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

In both midrashim Moshe was devoured by an angelic force, though in Shmot Rabbah it is one unnamed angel instead of two named ones. But the primary difference of note lies not in the angels but in how Moshe was swallowed: not to his feet, but up until his circumcised member.**^[270]{.underline}^** Like Rabbi Yehudah, Shmot Rabbah leans on Moshe's incapacitation to explain why Tzipporah was the heroine of the story, but unlike Rabbi Yehudah it also uncovers an explanation for how Tzipporah knew circumcision was the key to averting disaster. Moshe's circumcision led Tzipporah to correctly deduce what exactly prevented the angel from consuming him entirely.

The difference between these two teachings revolves around what set of textual and contextual questions are most in need of explanation. Rabbi Yehudah is interested in removing any ambiguity surrounding the phrase *"she touched his feet with the foreskin" (Shmot 4:25)*. The object of this pasuk is unclear, and arguing that Moshe was swallowed to his feet addresses this linguistic issue. However, another reading would suggest that it was the circumcised child's feet which were touched as a concluding ritual of the circumcision ceremony.**^[271]{.underline}^** If so, this particular textual issue is less critical than the larger, contextual question of how Tzipporah knew that *brit milah* would placate the angel. The author of Shmot Rabbah adopts Rabbi Yehudah's general explanation in the Talmud to resolve this thematic difficulty, while willingly sacrificing Rabbi Yehudah's explicit resolution to the subject of *"his feet"* in the process.**^[272]{.underline}^**

Even after analyzing these teachings, however, we remain unsatisfied. Could there be another way to interpret this episode that not only answers all the questions posed earlier but also takes into account the broader context of these pesukim, and thereby demonstrates how this story, instead of being merely an isolated incident with no apparent consequence, is in fact critical to subsequent narratives?

**[Moshe's Oath]{.underline}**

Which of Moshe's two sons was circumcised by Tzipporah in this story? There is not unanimous consensus on this issue in Rabbinic literature. While most traditional *mefarshim* join Shmot Rabbah in equating the circumcised child with Moshe's second son Eliezer,**^[273]{.underline}^** Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael identifies him as the eldest son Gershom:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
שבשעה שאמר משה ליתרו, תן לי צפורה בתך לאשה, אמר לו יתרו, קבל עליך דבר זה שאומר לך ואני נותנה לך לאשה, אמר לו מהו, אמר לו בן שיהיה לך תחלה יהיה לעבודה זרה, מכאן ואילך לשם שמים, וקבל עליו. אמר לו השבע לי, וישבע לו, שנ' (שם ב, כא) ויואל משה. אין אלה אלא לשון שבועה שנ' (שמו"א יד, כד) ויואל שאול את העם לאמר, וכתיב (מל"ב ה, כג) ויאמר נעמן הואל וקח ככרים. לפיכך הקדים המלאך להרוג את משה, מיד ותקח צפורה צר ותכרות את ערלת בנה וגו' וירף וגו':**^[274]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"When Moshe said to Yitro: Give me Tzipporah your daughter as a wife, Yitro said to him: Accept upon yourself that which I am saying to you and I will give her to you as a wife. He said to him: What is it? He said to him: The first child that you have shall be dedicated to Avodah Zarah, but any children thereafter can be dedicated to heaven. Moshe accepted it upon himself. Yitro said: Swear to me. Moshe swore to him, as it says: 'Moshe was content' (Shmot 2:21). There is no 'alah' except when it means a vow, as it says: 'Shaul made the nation swear, saying' (Shmuel Aleph 14:24), and it says: 'Naaman said swear and take some loaves' (Melachim Bet 5:23). This is why the angel first tried to kill Moshe, and immediately: 'Tzipporah took a rock and cut of the foreskin of her son ... he left him alone.'"**^[274]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Moshe, desperate to receive Tzipporah's hand in marriage, was compelled into a strange arrangement demanded by his father-in-law, the idolatrous priest of Midian. The terms are shocking as they are unexpected: Moshe agrees to dedicate his firstborn son to *Avodah Zarah* in the tradition of his maternal grandfather, releasing any future children from a similar fate*.* It is due to this agreement that Gershom had remained uncircumcised, presumably for many years.

Targum Yonatan preserves this tradition as well, albeit with some variations:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַהֲוָה בְאוֹרְחָה בְּבֵית מִבְתּוֹתָא וְעַרַע בֵּיהּ מַלְאָכָא דַיְיָ וּבְעָא לְמִקְטְלֵיהּ מִן בִּגְלַל גֵרְשׁוֹם בְּרֵיהּ דְלָא הֲוָה גְזִיר עַל עֵיסַק יִתְרוֹ חָמוֹי דְלָא שַׁבְקֵיהּ לְמִגְזְרֵיהּ בְּרַם אֱלִיעֶזֶר הֲוָה גָזַר בִּתְּנָאָה דְאַתְנִיוּ תַּרְוֵיהוֹן: וּנְסִיבַת צִפּוֹרָה טִינְרָא וּגְזָרַת יַת עוּרְלַת גֵרְשׁוֹם בְרָהּ וְאַקְרִיבַת יַת גְזֵירַת מָהוּלְתָּא לְרַגְלוֹי דְמַלְאָךְ חַבָּלָא וַאֲמָרַת חַתְנָא בְּעָא לְמִיגְזוֹר וְחָמוֹי עַכִּיב וּכְדוֹן אֲדָם גְזוּרְתָּא הָדֵין יְכַפֵּר עַל חַתְנָא דִילִי: וּפְסַק מַלְאָךְ חַבָּלָא מִנֵיהּ בְּכֵן שַׁבְּחַת צִפּוֹרָה וַאֲמַרַת מַה חָבִיב הוּא אֲדָם גְזוּרְתָּא הָדֵין דְשֵׁזִיב יַת חֲתָנָא מִן יְדוֹי דְמַלְאָךְ חֲבָּלָא:**^[275]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"But it was on the way, in the place of lodging that the angel of Hashem met Moshe and sought to kill him, because Gershom his son had not been circumcised, inasmuch as Yitro his father-in-law had not permitted him to circumcise him. But, Eliezer had been circumcised due to an agreement between them. Tzipporah took a stone and circumcised the foreskin of Gershom her son, and brought the severed part to the feet of the angel of destruction and said: The son-in-law tried to circumcise but the father-in-law obstructed him, now let this blood of the circumcision atone for my husband. And the destroying angel left him alone, and Tzipporah gave thanks and said: 'How lovely is the blood of this circumcision that has delivered my husband from the angel of destruction.'"**^[275]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Are we actually suggesting that Moshe Rabbeinu, leader of Bnai Yisrael and the greatest prophet of all time, dedicated one of his sons to *Avodah Zarah*? It seems stranger than fiction, ridiculous and absurd, and if it was not already written one would never dream to imagine it: **^[276]{.underline}^** מדרש כתוב אי אפשר לאומרו. It is only upon closer investigation that this midrash begins to reveal its hidden profundity.

Tzipporah knew that Gershom needed a *brit milah* because she knew the terms of her father's contract with Moshe. Moshe had been required to forgo this mitzvah in order to have her hand in marriage; Gershom would never have been conceived had it not been for Moshe's acquiescence to Yitro's demands. It follows that HaKadosh Baruch Hu sought to punish Moshe for years of purposeful neglect, not because of some short, ill-advised delay in a motel. And the curtain is fully wrenched back to reveal what propelled Tzipporah to act while Moshe inexplicably dallied: Moshe, hands wrung and head hanging low, believed himself powerless to save his own son. Not because of angels or Satan or even HaKadosh Baruch Hu, but because of an oath he swore to Tzipporah's father many years before. Moshe's sin was not due to laziness, confusion, or a lapse in judgment, but he did have his priorities horribly mixed up: not in thinking that *brit milah* can wait until after he unpacked his suitcase, but in fundamentally misunderstanding that his promise to Yitro can and should be discarded to save Gershom's life.

Yet why should this be so? A man's word is considered of paramount importance, and the violation of any oath should be treated severely.**^[277]{.underline}^** How should Moshe have been expected to intuit that *brit milah* should take precedence over his vow? The midrash does not explicitly tell us why Moshe was mistaken for maintaining his oath to Yitro, but several suggestions can be offered:

- As with any descendant of Avraham, Moshe had an obligation to perform *brit milah* on his son. Any vow not to fulfill a mitzvah is an example of what halachah calls a vain oath (*shevu'at shav*), and it is considered meaningless, null and void.**^[278]{.underline}^**

- Any vow a person makes to sell something which does not yet exist - but will only come into existence at some point in the future - is not binding. Moshe's sale of his unborn son to Yitro was in reality invalid from day one.**^[279]{.underline}^**

- Moshe should have realized that Tzipporah was permitted to perform a *brit milah* instead of him. This would allow him to not directly and personally violate his oath to Yitro, while also having his son receive a *brit milah*.**^[280]{.underline}^**

- Moshe erred by making an oath in the first place, and the problem was not so much in his insistence on keeping it - for once an oath is made, it must be kept - but that it was done to begin with.**^[281]{.underline}^**

- The oath may have only been while Moshe lived in Midian under Yitro's jurisdiction. Perhaps once he left for Egypt (with the latter's blessing) it was no longer in force.

There is an unusual interplay between narrative (highlighted in green) and Divine command (highlighted in blue) in these pesukim, an oscillation between account and speech that demands explanation. A more logical flow would juxtapose Hashem's directives to Moshe (19, 21-23) and then tell the story of Moshe traveling to Egypt (20, 24-26). Why does the Torah break up HaKadosh Baruch Hu's directives to Moshe in this way?

(יט) וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֶל מֹשֶׁה֙ בְּמִדְיָ֔ן לֵ֖ךְ שֻׁ֣ב מִצְרָ֑יִם כִּי מֵ֙תוּ֙ כׇּל הָ֣אֲנָשִׁ֔ים הַֽמְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃ (כ) וַיִּקַּ֨ח מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶת אִשְׁתּ֣וֹ וְאֶת בָּנָ֗יו וַיַּרְכִּבֵם֙ עַֽל הַחֲמֹ֔ר וַיָּ֖שׇׁב אַ֣רְצָה מִצְרָ֑יִם וַיִּקַּ֥ח מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת מַטֵּ֥ה הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים בְּיָדֽוֹ׃ (כא) וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָה֮ אֶל מֹשֶׁה֒ בְּלֶכְתְּךָ֙ לָשׁ֣וּב מִצְרַ֔יְמָה רְאֵ֗ה כׇּל הַמֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְיָדֶ֔ךָ וַעֲשִׂיתָ֖ם לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וַאֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת לִבּ֔וֹ וְלֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת הָעָֽם׃ (כב) וְאָמַרְתָּ֖ אֶל פַּרְעֹ֑ה כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּנִ֥י בְכֹרִ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ (כג) וָאֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗יךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת בְּנִי֙ וְיַֽעַבְדֵ֔נִי וַתְּמָאֵ֖ן לְשַׁלְּח֑וֹ הִנֵּה֙ אָנֹכִ֣י הֹרֵ֔ג אֶת בִּנְךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽךָ׃ (כד) וַיְהִ֥י בַדֶּ֖רֶךְ בַּמָּל֑וֹן וַיִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣הוּ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַיְבַקֵּ֖שׁ הֲמִיתֽוֹ׃ (כה) וַתִּקַּ֨ח צִפֹּרָ֜ה צֹ֗ר וַתִּכְרֹת֙ אֶת עׇרְלַ֣ת בְּנָ֔הּ וַתַּגַּ֖ע לְרַגְלָ֑יו וַתֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֧י חֲתַן דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽי׃ (כו) וַיִּ֖רֶף מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אָ֚ז אָֽמְרָ֔ה חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַמּוּלֹֽת׃

The key lies in noticing that a double entendre is embedded in pasuk 23. *"And I say to you: Send My son free so that he may worship Me, for if you refuse to send him I shall kill your firstborn son."* This pasuk is at once the conclusion of Moshe's threat to Pharaoh, a warning against Pharaoh's refusal to release the Jews, and at the same time a command directed not at Pharaoh but at Moshe himself.

Read through the lens of Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael, pasuk 23 becomes: *"And I say to you Moshe, not Pharaoh: Send My son Gershom free from his uncircumcised state via brit milah so that he may throw off the shackles of idolatry and worship Me, for if you refuse to send him I shall kill your uncircumcised firstborn son Gershom."*

The potential death of a firstborn son is a reference not only to the tenth plague but to Moshe's imprisoned son Gershom. Only by arranging the pesukim in this manner can the Torah imbue HaKadosh Baruch Hu's words with both meanings. And only when understood this way does the next pasuk become obvious: *"And it was on the way in the hotel that Hashem met him and sought to kill him" (Shmot 4:24)*. Moshe did not circumcise Gershom and so Hashem came to kill him, just as He had warned in the previous pasuk. This explanation also sheds light on why Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael identifies the unnamed child with the eldest son, and not the younger son as most commentators believe: what happens to Moshe is a microcosm, foreshadowing what will eventually happen to all of Egypt.

The radical claims made by this midrash do resolve many of the linguistic and thematic problems presented by the pesukim, but something is still missing. Midrash aggadah is also concerned with unifying Torah wherever possible and weaving disparate conceptual threads together. It is clear that this midrash purposely deviates from a straightforward reading of the pesukim**^[282]{.underline}^** for the reasons mentioned, yet is there more to the idea that it was Gershom who had been dedicated by Moshe to a life of *Avodah Zarah* instead of Eliezer?

One of the fundamental, oft-repeated phenomena underlying many stories in Sefer Breishit is the inevitable tension found between brothers.
These tensions are not meant to be understood merely as differences of personality, although that is certainly a factor at play; rather, they signify a cosmic clash between the forces of righteousness and wickedness. This dichotomy of chosenness vs rejection, of fidelity to G-d vs worship of other gods, is elevated by the Torah itself from mere sibling rivalry to an epic battle of primacy between good and evil, a framing sharpened time and again throughout the aggadah.**^[283]{.underline}^** Ultimately, this war between Yaakov/Yisrael and Edav/Edom is destined to rage until the end of times.**^[284]{.underline}^**

A decision between life and death, thrust upon every individual while also inspired by this national drama, is described by Moshe in his parting words to Bnai Yisrael:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
רְאֵ֨ה נָתַ֤תִּי לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ הַיּ֔וֹם אֶת הַֽחַיִּ֖ים וְאֶת הַטּ֑וֹב וְאֶת הַמָּ֖וֶת וְאֶת הָרָֽע׃ ... הַעִדֹ֨תִי בָכֶ֣ם הַיּוֹם֮ אֶת הַשָּׁמַ֣יִם וְאֶת הָאָ֒רֶץ֒ הַחַיִּ֤ים וְהַמָּ֙וֶת֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לְפָנֶ֔יךָ הַבְּרָכָ֖ה וְהַקְּלָלָ֑ה וּבָֽחַרְתָּ֙ בַּחַיִּ֔ים לְמַ֥עַן תִּֽחְיֶ֖ה אַתָּ֥ה וְזַרְעֶֽךָ׃**^[285]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"See I have given before you today the choice between life and good on the one hand, and death and evil on the other hand ... I call heaven and earth to witness against you today: I have given before you the choice between life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life, so that you and your offspring can live."**^[285]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Listen to HaKadosh Baruch Hu, Moshe adjures the nation, and you shall prosper; get seduced by the snare of false gods, and death is assuredly just around the corner.**^[286]{.underline}^**

The Torah's silence on Moshe's children does not demand aggadic elaboration merely because we should take an interest in the details of his personal life. It is demanded due to the backdrop of Moshe's ancestry, indeed the ancestry of Bnai Yisrael as a whole: a history littered with conflict between two sons. Adam HaRishon's eldest son Kayin has his offering rejected by G-d, while Adam's second son Hevel's offering is accepted;**^[287]{.underline}^** Avraham's eldest son Yishmael is driven out in deference to Yitzchak; Yitzchak's eldest son Esav is unpleasant at best and an apostate at worst,**^[288]{.underline}^** while Yaakov inherits the mantle of fathering Bnai Yisrael. Even Menashe and Efraim are deliberately forced by Yaakov into the framework of a younger son being greater than an older one in the closing chapters of Sefer Breishit.

Now the stage has been set, and Biblical history demands continuity. We are told that Moshe, human vessel for redemption and messiah heralding the Divine's defeat of His enemies, also had two sons. Must they not too have been split? *"One goat marked for Hashem, and one goat marked for Azazel" (Vayikra 16:8)*; one son dedicated to HaKadosh Baruch Hu, one dedicated to the forces of evil.

Moshe himself embodies this struggle between chosenness and rejection within his personality and upbringing: a self-appointed stranger in Egypt and Midian as demonstrated by Gershom's name, yet also adopted son of one and son-in-law of the other. Moshe agreeing to Yitro's stipulation represents the convoluted nature of Moshe's own identity: he is half renegade Jew who sympathizes with his people's plight, but also half Egyptian and Midianite prince. Moshe agrees to Yitro's demand to assuage the conflict within himself; his own ambivalence will be bifurcated through his children into cleanly delineated sides, one good and one evil.**^[289]{.underline}^**

Which son, then, should be resigned to the worship of *Avodah Zarah*? One could suggest that Yitro's motivation for wanting Gershom is that the firstborn son was primary in the Ancient World, especially when it came to priestly service. However, by reading the dynamic between Moshe's two sons as not just a reflection of his own split persona, but as a continuation of the Yisrael-vs-Edom paradigm, Gershom must be the one destined for inferiority, just as firstborn sons Kayin, Yishmael, Esav and Menashe had been. The story of Sefer Breishit is the story of younger siblings supplanting their entitled brothers who are relegated to a lower status, and our midrash adds another link to this chain: Moshe Rabbeinu's children have been transformed into yet another installment of that age-old conflict.

Let us now turn our attention away from Moshe's past and look towards his future. Gershom was raised in his youth by a protective grandfather who was also the head priest of Midian and dedicated to the service of *Avodah Zarah*. He was then claimed by G-d as His and forcibly circumcised in a traumatic *brit milah* ceremony. Unlike Yitzchak - intended for slaughter but ultimately spared - Gershom's foreskin was violently removed, his blood spilled. What, then, should we expect from Gershom's relationship with *"the G-d of Moshe's father" (Shmot 18:4)*? Surely an event such as the one told in Shmot 4:24-26 must have repercussions, and tragic ones at that, yet the Torah remains conspicuously silent. What ever happened to Moshe's children and their descendants?

**[Idolatrous Prophet]{.underline}**

Gershom and Eliezer only appear again explicitly one other time in the entire Tanach:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"Amram's sons were Aharon and Moshe. Aharon was set apart, he and his sons forever, to be consecrated as most holy, to offer incense before Hashem and to serve him and bless with his name for all time. As for Moshe, the man of G-d: his sons were named after the tribe of Levi. Moshe's sons were Gershom and Eliezer. Gershom's sons: Shevuel the chief. Eliezer's sons: Rechaviah the chief. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but Rechaviah's children were very numerous."**^[290]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Gershom had a son named Shevuel and Eliezer had a son named Rechaviah, both of whom - aside from being Moshe's grandsons - were men of authority. This passage is short and dry, a chronological account without much aggadically favorable substance to it. Far more interesting is a veiled reference to Gershom found in Sefer Shoftim:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

"The offspring of Dan established the idol, and Yehonatan Ben Gershom Ben Menashe - he and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the land went into exile. They maintained the idol that Micha had made all the time that the house of G-d stood at Shiloh."**^[291]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

According to Masoretic tradition the נ of מנשה must be suspended in the air and written smaller than other letters. Exegetically this means we are allowed to ignore its existence, which would then render the name of this Danite priest as Yehonatan Ben Gershom Ben Moshe. A mysterious Levite who suddenly appears only to never be mentioned again, who works as a Kohen for idolatry and whose father's name is Gershom son of Moshe - surely this must be the final link, a continuation and culmination of the complex interplay between Yitro, Moshe and Gershom.

Shir HaShirim Rabbah records a tradition about Yehonatan which can also be found with some variations and additions in the Talmud Yerushalmi Berachot:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"Rabbi Meir entered and taught: There was an old prophet dwelling in Beit El' (Melachim Aleph 13:11). Who was this? Amaziah HaKohen of Beit El a false prophet found in Amos 7:10. Rabbi Yosi said to him: Meir, this is utter stupidity. Who was that? Yehonatan Ben Gershom Ben Moshe, as it says: 'Yehonatan Ben Gershom Ben Menashe' (Shoftim 18:30). The Masoretic tradition records a hanging nun suspended in the air, which means if he merits it, he is the son of Moshe, but if he does not merit it, he is the son of Menashe ... They said: when David died he returned to his former bad ways. That is what is written: 'He said to him I am a prophet like you ... he deceived him' (Melachim Aleph 13:18). What does 'he deceived him' mean? He lied to him. And how did he lie to him? He fed him bread of falsehoods, as it says: 'They were sitting at the table and the word of Hashem came to the prophet that brought the man of G-d back with him' (Melachim Aleph 13:20)."**^[292]{.underline}^**

"Rabbi Huna and Shimon Kamataria said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman: 'Yehonatan Ben Gershom Ben Menashe' (Shoftim 18:30). The Masoretic tradition records a hanging nun suspended in the air, which means if he merits it, he is the son of Moshe, but if he does not merit it, he is the son of Menashe. The Rabbis asked before Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman: He was a priest of idol worship and lived so long? He said to them: the reason he merited such a long life is because Yehonatan was grudging towards his idol. How was he grudging towards his idol? If a man came to sacrifice an ox, a sheep, or a goat to the idol and told him: Make it favorably inclined towards me, he would say: What use does it have for you? It neither sees, nor hears, nor eats, nor drinks, nor does good or evil, and does not talk ... When David became king, he sent and brought him. He said to him: You are the grandson of that righteous man Moshe and you worship idols? He said to him: I have a tradition from my grandfather's house: Sell yourself to Avodah Zarah rather than need other people. David said to him: Heaven forbid. He did not say so, but rather sell yourself to work that is strange to you rather than need other people i.e. not idol worship but 'strange work'. When David saw that he loved money, he made him overseer of his treasuries. That is what is written: 'Shevuel Ben Gershom Ben Moshe, overseer of the treasuries' (Divrei HaYamim Aleph 26:24). Shevuel - because he returned to G-d with all his heart and all his might. 'Overseer of the treasuries' - he made him count of the treasuries. They objected to Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman: 'Yehonatan and his descendants served until the day the land went into exile' (Shoftim 18:30). He said to them: When David died, Shlomo rose and exchanged all his counselors. Yehonatan returned to his former bad ways after that. That is what is written: 'There was an old prophet dwelling in Beit El' (Melachim Aleph 13:11). They say: this prophet was Yehonatan."**^[293]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

A small letter such as the נ found in Yehonatan's grandfather's name, while not unique in the Masoretic text, is quite rare. This gives the aggadah creative license to interpret such a word as if it were written both with and without the small letter, an exegetical technique we also find elsewhere.**^[294]{.underline}^** If Moshe is the paradigmatic symbol of righteousness, then Menashe is the his polar opposite, the quintessential example of wickedness and rebellion against HaKadosh Baruch Hu; as a result of his horrific actions Menashe was even denied a share in the World to Come.**^[295]{.underline}^** Yehonatan was biologically the grandson of Moshe but acted as a priest for *Avodah Zarah*. Tanach dares not insult Moshe's honor by having his name associated with his offspring's nefarious activities.**^[296]{.underline}^** The נ is suspended in midair, as if to say that technically Yehonatan was Moshe's Rabbeinu's grandson, but his behavior and life choices draw him towards Menashe.

If this priest was indeed Moshe's grandson, a basic question of chronology arises. Hundreds of years had elapsed between *Yetziat Mitzrayim* and the story of Micha's idol told in Sefer Shoftim 18. How could Moshe's grandson possibly still be alive?**^[297]{.underline}^** Like many other midrashim concerned with conserving Biblical characters, the claim is that Yehonatan merited to live an extraordinary number of years, far beyond those of a normal lifespan.

When questioned in the Talmud Yerushalmi why Yehonatan merited such a long life, Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman paints a portrait of a man who's relationship with *Avodah Zarah* is complicated and self-contradictory. He serves idols, but only as a way to earn a living. He does not believe in them or their power, but facilitates and enables idolatrous practices. We are also told that like Menashe King of Yehudah, Yehonatan repented and returned to HaKadosh Baruch Hu with a full heart - Yehonatan son of Gershom of course being identical with the chief Shevuel son of Gershom recorded in Divrei HaYamim Aleph - only to then revert back to a path of wickedness and immorality. He is even equated with a false prophet who also receives actual *nevuah* in the days of Yeravam Ben Nevat, first King of *Malchut Yisrael*.**^[298]{.underline}^** What is motivating Rabbi Shmuel's bizarre elaboration of Yehonatan's character?

In isolation the scope of this midrash may be confusing, but the justification for its ambition becomes clear when we read it through the lens of Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael quoted earlier. Gershom, son of Moshe, spent his entire childhood being dragged back and forth in a custody battle between Yitro and Moshe, between G-dliness and idolatry, and as a result condemned to dance back and forth between two belief systems, unsure where the truth actually lies and not really at home in either one. Born a servant of Yitro's god in Midian, then circumcised by his mother for Hashem; sent home to Midian, then brought back to rendezvous with G-d's people by his idolatrous grandfather. What hope did Gershom really have to ever develop a cohesive and consistent theology for himself and his own children?

The consequence of such a messy upbringing is obvious: a lack of strong commitment towards anything specific for one's entire life, a defense mechanism to not get too close out of fear of being pulled in a different direction and forced to change one's entire religious outlook. Yehonatan - like his father Gershom before him - is a Kohen of idolatry, one who insensitively downplays his congregants' beliefs; his religious values are ungrounded and circumstantial.**^[299]{.underline}^** He is interested in making a decent living, for in that he can be certain; as to the question of what role G-d or gods actively play in the world, however, in his heart of hearts he remains aloof and distant. Even his return to Hashem, a miraculous overturning of the trauma he inherited from his father, is short-lived: his inner turmoil cannot be left at bay for long, and he soon slides back into a life of indifference and inconsistency.

That is precisely why - as Rabbi Yosi scoffingly declares to Rabbi Meir in Shir HaShirim Rabbah - Yehonatan and not Amaziah HaKohen is the best candidate for the false prophet in Melachim Aleph 13. The story told there is unsettling: motives are left unstated, incentives are blurry and ambiguous. If in a previous life Yehonatan had been an idolatrous Kohen who dissuaded the masses from worshiping properly, his transformation into a vengeful old man who actively has a prophet killed but then receives prophecy himself is strangely fitting. Yehonatan's behavior of straddling the fence between righteousness and wickedness, between worship of Hashem and worship of Ba'al: this is the sad legacy which began with Moshe and was perpetuated by Gershom, instigated by that fateful circumcision on the way down to Egypt. Moshe's decision in first making an ill-informed pact with Yitro and his subsequent dereliction in circumcising Gershom led to Gershom being fed "sour grapes", and this in turn led to a domino effect, destroying the life of his grandson Yehonatan.**^[300]{.underline}^**

**[Second Cousins]{.underline}**

We find another important figure in Jewish history during the period of Shoftim: Aharon's grandson Pinchas.**^[301]{.underline}^** He was both *Kohen* and *Navi* for HaKadosh Baruch Hu, zealous for His honor and absolutely convinced of His justice. Moshe's grandson Yehonatan, while also involved in the politics of the time, led a life of mediocrity, passivity and compromise, inheriting the uncertainties and insecurities that were an outgrowth of his father Gershom's syncretism.

And with this understanding, a beautiful interpretation emerges: a message hidden between the lines of Eliyahu at Har HaCarmel. While trying to win over the hearts of the people, frustrated with the nation's indecision, Eliyahu desperately demands an answer:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיִּגַּ֨שׁ אֵלִיָּ֜הוּ אֶל כׇּל הָעָ֗ם וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ עַד מָתַ֞י אַתֶּ֣ם פֹּסְחִים֮ עַל שְׁתֵּ֣י הַסְּעִפִּים֒ אִם יְהֹוָ֤ה הָאֱלֹהִים֙ לְכ֣וּ אַחֲרָ֔יו וְאִם הַבַּ֖עַל לְכ֣וּ אַחֲרָ֑יו וְלֹא עָנ֥וּ הָעָ֛ם אֹת֖וֹ דָּבָֽר׃ וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלִיָּ֙הוּ֙ אֶל הָעָ֔ם אֲנִ֞י נוֹתַ֧רְתִּי נָבִ֛יא לַיהֹוָ֖ה לְבַדִּ֑י וּנְבִיאֵ֣י הַבַּ֔עַל אַרְבַּע מֵא֥וֹת וַחֲמִשִּׁ֖ים אִֽישׁ׃**^[302]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Eliyahu approached the nation and said: How long will you keep hopping back and forth between two opinions? If Hashem is G-d, follow Him, and if Baal is god, follow him! But the nation had nothing to answer him. Eliyahu then said to the nation: I alone remain as a prophet of Hashem, while the prophets of Baal are 450 men."**^[302]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

If Yehonatan really is the unnamed prophet in Melachim Aleph 13 as Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachman contends, it is not at all inconceivable that he was among the nation present on that fateful day at Har HaCarmel.**^[303]{.underline}^**

Eliyahu continues the legacy of his grandfather Aharon and father Elazar, whose lives represented the idea of fidelity to G-d no matter what life throws at you and consistency through daily service and ritual as *Kohen Gadol*. But his second cousin Yehonatan inherited a very different religious legacy, for Moshe had not *"tended to his fruit"* in the way that Aharon had. Gershom's childhood was spent, not at his father Moshe's side in service of G-d, but back and forth between the world of Israelite belief and that of Midianite apostasy. He was an old man, still agonized after hundreds of years, and tired of his constant state of internal unrest.

Eliyahu's cry of *"How long will you keep hopping back and forth between two opinions"*,**^[304]{.underline}^** while aimed at the entire nation, struck Yehonatan at the core of his very being; he, along with the rest of the nation, *"had nothing to answer him"*. Eliyahu was hinting to his cousin - also present in the crowd**^[305]{.underline}^** - that even after centuries of searching and flip-flopping, the blood of Gershom's circumcision and what it represented still stained his son even after centuries had passed. Only Eliyahu *"alone remains as a prophet of Hashem"*, of Hashem specifically; Yonatan too remains, but as a *navi sheker*, a false prophet, still cursed with the ambivalence and ambiguity that sprang into being hundreds of years earlier.

What became of Yonatan? Did he remain in his tragic, sunken state until his dying breath, or did he eventually achieve redemption? After a lifetime of oscillation between chosenness and rejection, was he able, in the words of Bamidbar Rabbah 3:2 (see **Note 40**), to *come close*? In this, the foil between Pinchas and Yonatan truly comes full circle, for not only did both live extraordinarily long lives - keeping the outstretching arms of the Angel of Death at bay for centuries - but perhaps they also cheated death as well. Pinchas, also known as Eliyahu, did not die; as a reward for his steadfastness he merited to ascend to Heaven alive in a whirlwind.**^[306]{.underline}^** Yonatan died but was resurrected, his revival perhaps representing a final cleansing of his past and a purification of his soul.

When Elisha, the student of Eliyahu, died and was buried, a strange story is told of an unidentified man whose bones touched Elisha's bones and who miraculously came back to life.**^[307]{.underline}^** Resurrection from the dead is not a common occurrence, to say the least; why did this anonymous man merit a supernatural revival? The Talmud suggests an answer to this obvious question, arguing that this person was wicked, and because the wicked and the righteous cannot be buried together, he was brought back to life so that his bones would not lie next to those of the righteous prophet Elisha:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
דאמר ר' אחא בר חנינא מנין שאין קוברין רשע אצל צדיק שנאמר (מלכים ב יג, כא) ויהי הם קוברים איש והנה ראו את הגדוד וישליכו את האיש בקבר אלישע ויגע האיש בעצמות אלישע ויחי ויקם על רגליו. אמר ליה רב פפא ודילמא לאיקיומא (מלכים ב ב, ט) ויהי נא פי שנים ברוחך אלי? אמר ליה אי הכי היינו דתניא על רגליו עמד ולביתו לא הלך אלא ויהי נא פי שנים היכי משכחת לה דאחייא א"ל רבי יוחנן שריפא צרעת נעמן שהיא שקולה כמת דכתיב (במדבר יב, יב) אל נא תהי כמת:**^[308]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Rav Aha Bar Hanina said, how do we know that the wicked should not be buried next to the righteous? As it says: 'It happened that people were burying a man, and when they saw the raiding band they threw the man into the grave of Elisha. The man touched the bones of Elisha, and came to life; and stood up on his legs.' (Melachim Bet 13:21). Rav Pappa said to him, perhaps this person was resurrected in order to fulfill: 'May twice your spirit rest upon me' (Melachim Bet 2:9) and since Eliyahu resurrected the dead once and Elisha resurrected the dead once, in order for Eliyahu's blessing to come to fruition Elisha still had to resurrect a second time? He said to him, if so, what about that which was taught: He stood on his legs, but did not go to his home? Meaning, he died right after he moved away from Elisha's bones. If so, where do we find the fulfillment of: 'May twice your spirit rest upon me'? Rabbi Yohanan said, that Elisha healed Na'aman's tzara'at, which is considered like death, as it says: 'Do not let her be as dead' (Bamidbar 12:12)."**^[308]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

In his commentary to this Talmudic discussion Rashi explicitly equates the person who was resurrected with the false prophet from Melachim Aleph 13:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
אותו הנקבר נביא השקר היה הוא הנביא אשר השיב את עידו לאכול ולשתות בבית אל ונענש עידו על ידו והמיתו הארי וכשמת לאחר ימים קברוהו אצל אלישע ולא הוכשר אצל המקום שיקבר אצלו והחייהו]:**^[309]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"That buried man was the false prophet who tricked Iddo to eat and drink in his house, and Iddo was punished on his account and killed by a lion, and when the false prophet died after some years he was buried with Elisha, but he was not worthy of that place to be buried next to Elisha, because the wicked are not to be buried next to the righteous, and so he came back to life."**^[309]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is some difficulty with Rashi's approach, as the false prophet explicitly adjured his family to bury him alongside the true prophet - identified by Rashi as Iddo - whose death he caused,**^[310]{.underline}^** and we are told that his burial wish had indeed been fulfilled.**^[311]{.underline}^** So how could this man's bones have touched those of Elisha - thereby bringing him back to life - if he is identical to the man whose bones were found by Yoshiyahu centuries later?**^[312]{.underline}^**

If we connect this aggadic tradition cited by Rashi with the idea found in **Notes 48 and 49** that the false prophet in question was actually Yonatan Ben Gershom Ben Moshe, we find that Moshe's grandson actually came back from the dead. Thus the parallel between Pinchas/Eliyahu and Yonatan/Shevu'el is complete: both lived extraordinarily long lives, from before Yehoshua conquered Eretz Yisrael until the days of Elisha the prophet; and both had a legacy which outlasted an earthly death: Eliyahu went to Heaven alive, while Yonatan was resurrected and came back to life.

It can even be argued that, while the Talmud prefers not to accept Rav Pappa's argument, his attempt to find in Yonatan's resurrection a fulfillment of Eliyahu's double blessing to Elisha would imply that Yonatan merited rebirth due to the legacy of Eliyahu. And thus, in life and in death, Eliyahu redeems Yonatan: in life, when he rebukes him for his half-heartedness, prompting genuine internal reflection, and in death, when his blessing brings his cousin back to life.**^[313]{.underline}^**

Aharon was comforted by Moshe's presence at Hor HaHar, for he realized that his legacy as an *Eved Hashem* would continue through Elazar and his descendants while Moshe's legacy would end with his death. And so it was: Aharon's grandson Pinchas/Eliyahu kept the faith like his father before him, while Moshe's grandson Yehonatan had nothing to answer, like his father before him. Because Elazar received the crown from Aharon, and then Pinchas received it from Elazar, Aharon merited having his grandson loyal to HaKadosh Baruch Hu and His Torah hundreds of years after he was buried, a legacy enshrined for generations to come. Gershom and Eliezer *"sat idly and did not learn Torah"*, for they could not overcome the contradictions of their childhood and the distance from their biological father. Moshe's descendants were doomed to dwell in the shadows, unable on their own to throw off the shackles of syncretic confusion from their childhood.

There are two important lessons to be extracted from the success of Aharon and the misfortune of Moshe. The first is the importance of marrying into, and surrounding oneself by, a righteous family. טוב לצדיק טוב לשכנו: people are influenced by their families and environment. Look no further than the story of Zimri and Kozbi: Pinchas recognized the danger of a union between Jew and Midianite and took action to stamp it out, whereas Moshe - himself married to a Midianite - was crying in despair, unable to act.**^[314]{.underline}^**

The second lesson is the importance of proper *chinuch*, and the enormous implications of doing it incorrectly. A single, traumatic event can have an incalculable impact on a child's life and beliefs, and the butterfly effect of that can have unintended consequences for a long time. The curse of conflicting deities led to a nagging sense of doubt which began with Gershom's circumcision, continued with his mother's banishment back to Midian and subsequent return to Har Sinai, and still reverberated and held sway at Har HaCarmel centuries later, much to Eliyahu's chagrin. Invest in your children's education and values, and sacrifice whatever it takes to impart on them your religious convictions. Otherwise, you may find yourself like Moshe Rabbeinu, bewailing your impending doom and having no one left to comfort you.**^[315]{.underline}^**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Names have an important role to play in Hazal's aggadic toolbox. They often carry special significance about the people they designate, and the Rabbis were fond of explaining how names are related to the events of a particular person's life.**^[316]{.underline}^** It is even claimed that people used to be named - or perhaps more accurately, renamed - by the Torah based on important events that happened to them.**^[317]{.underline}^**

This idea also extended beyond the normal bounds of aggadic exercise and interpretation. Names were not merely seen as a tool that could be used to uncover additional layers and meaning of a given text. There was also a belief that names are causal; the essence of a person's name can have a real, actual, material impact on his personality and life.**^[318]{.underline}^** Some Rabbis were inclined to judge people as righteous or wicked based on their names and react accordingly; for example, Rabbi Meir refused to entrust his belongings with an innkeeper who had a "wicked" name, thereby preventing the man from cheating him the next day.**^[319]{.underline}^** Names, in other words, are not just explanatory, but also predictive.

It is with this in mind that we turn our attention to Moshe's wife, Tzipporah. Unlike Moshe, Gershom or Eliezer - whose names are explained by the Torah (Shmot 2:10, 2:22, and 18:4 respectively) - the reason behind Tzipporah's name is not given. The most straightforward rendering is that her name is related to a female bird, but does this have anything to do with her character or any of her stories we are familiar with?

One explanation relates her name to the "bridegroom of blood" story discussed above (Shmot 4:24-26). Moshe and Tzipporah were confronted by G-d Himself who sought to kill them, so it would have been an understandable reaction had they panicked and frozen up under pressure.**^[320]{.underline}^** Instead, Tzipporah took drastic, dangerous measures to save her family, and did so without hesitation. This instinctual response evokes for us the image of a mother bird hovering over her eggs protectively.**^[321]{.underline}^** Another midrash also relates Tzipporah's name to a bird's speed, but ties it to a different episode: her running to fetch Moshe from the well after he saves her and her sisters from abusive shepherds.**^[322]{.underline}^**

It is a different tradition, however, which demands our attention and scrutiny. Tzipporah's name is connected to the concept of purity and blood:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
ד"א למה נקראת צפורה שטיהרה כל בית אביה כדם הציפור:**^[323]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Why was her name Tzipporah? Because she purified her entire father's house like the blood of a bird."**^[323]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

It might be tempting to understand this as acknowledging that because Tzipporah's marriage to Moshe eventually led to her father Yitro recognizing Hashem - which then logically led the rest of his family to follow suit - the purification of Yitro and his house from the sins of *Avodah Zarah* is in her merit. But could there be a deeper, thematic connection between Tzipporah's essence on the one hand, and the *"purified ... blood of a bird"* on the other hand? And how does this connect to Tzipporah's relationship with Moshe and their children?

**[Back Home]{.underline}**

After Bnai Yisrael are delivered from Egypt and begin their wanderings in the desert, Yitro *"heard about what G-d did for Moshe and His nation Yisrael, that Hashem took Yisrael out of Mitzrayim" (Shmot 18:1)*. He travels to the desert to visit Moshe, and brings Tzipporah and her two sons with him *"after she was sent away" (Shmot 18:2)*. This revelation is unexpected, for the last time we encountered Tzipporah she was accompanying Moshe down to Egypt on his way to confront Pharaoh. When was she sent back to Midian, and why?

One midrash contends that Tzipporah and her children went back to Midian after they had already arrived in Egypt and spoke to Pharaoh, who responded by increasing the Jews' workload (Shmot 5:1-9). Not only that, but Moshe accompanied them there:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיֵּצְאוּ נֹגְשֵׂי הָעָם וְשֹׁטְרָיו, כֵּיוָן שֶׁגָּזַר כֵּן הָלַךְ משֶׁה לְמִדְיָן וְעָשָׂה שִׁשָּׁה חֳדָשִׁים וְאַהֲרֹן הָיָה יוֹשֵׁב בְּמִצְרַיִם, וְאוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה הֶחֱזִיר משֶׁה אִשְׁתּוֹ וּבָנָיו לְמִדְיָן:**^[324]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
'The taskmasters of the people and their officers went out' (Shmot 5:10). Once this decree was made Moshe went back to Midian and waited there for six months, and Aharon remained behind in Egypt. At that time Moshe also returned his wife and children to Midian."**^[324]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Unable to face the excessive suffering in Egypt which had repulsed him decades earlier, and eager to avoid responsibility for his initial failure to free the people, Moshe flees to Midian with his family for six months. He remains there until Hashem appears to him and commands him to try again, promising this time to actually begin the redemptive process.**^[325]{.underline}^**

A second midrash argues that Tzipporah was sent back to Midian by Moshe soon after she circumcised their son:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
ויקח יתרו חותן משה את צפורה אשת משה אחר שלוחיה. רבי יהושע אומר, אחר שנפטרה ממנו בגט. נאמר כאן שלוח ונאמר להלן שילוח, מה שלוח האמור להלן גט, אף כאן גט. רבי אלעזר המודעי אומר, מאחר שנפטרה ממנו במאמר, שבשעה שאמר הקדוש ברוך הוא למשה, לך הוצא את עמי בני ישראל ממצרים, שנאמר (שמות ג) ועתה לכה ואשלחך אל פרעה, באותה שעה נטל אשתו ושני בניו והיה מוליכם למצרים, שנ' (שמות ד, כ) ויקח משה את אשתו ואת בניו וירכיבם על החמור וישב ארצה מצרים. באותה שעה נאמר לאהרן, (שם) לך לקראת משה. יצא לקראת משה וחבקו ונשקו. א"ל משה היכן היית כל השנים הללו, אמר לו במדין. א"ל מה טף ונשים אלו עמך, אמר לו אשתי ובני. אמר לו, ולאן אתה מוליכם, אמר לו למצרים; א"ל על הראשונים אנו מצטערים ועכשיו נצטער גם באלו. באותה שעה אמר לצפורה, לכי לבית אביך. ובאותה שעה הלכה לבית אביה ונטלה שני בניה, לכך נאמר אחר שלוחיה:**^[326]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'Yitro, the father-in-law of Moshe, took Tzipporah, Moshe's wife, after she was sent away'. Rabbi Yehoshua said, after she was sent away from him with a divorce document: it says here 'sending away' and it says there 'sending away', just as the 'sending away' there means a divorce document, so too the 'sending away' here means a divorce document. Rabbi Elazar HaModa'i said, after she was sent away from him with words. When HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe, go take My nation Bnai Yisrael out of Egypt, as it says: 'Now go and I shall send you to Pharaoh' (Shmot 3), at that time Moshe took his wife and two sons and brought them with him to Egypt, as it says: 'Moshe took his wife and children and placed them on the donkey and returned to the land of Egypt' (Shmot 4:20). At that time it was said to Aharon: 'Go to Moshe'. He went to Moshe, hugged him and kissed him, and said to him, Moshe, where were you all these years? He said to him, in Midian. He said to him, who are these children and women with you? He said to him, my wife and sons. He said to him, where are you taking them? He said to him, Egypt. He said to him, we are in distress about the first ones, now you are adding these to the distress? At that time Moshe said to Tzipporah, go home to your father's house. At that time Tzipporah went back to her father's house and took her two sons, and therefore it says: 'After she was sent away.'"**^[326]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

It is Aharon who, after reuniting with his brother after many years,**^[327]{.underline}^** convinces Moshe that the last thing their mission needs is more people to worry about. Moshe sends Tzipporah and their children back to her father, and continues onward with Aharon to confront Pharaoh.

Both of these aggadot suggest that Tzipporah and her children were actually in Midian during *Yetziat Mitzrayim*. They did not merit to see firsthand the incredible signs and wonders that Bnai Yisrael were witness to. The awe-inspiring and prophetic**^[328]{.underline}^** events at *Yam Suf* that moved Bnai Yisrael to believe in G-d and Moshe and to sing His praises - Moshe's own family were not present at that momentous occasion.**^[329]{.underline}^** This implies that when the Torah records: *"Moshe told his father-in-law all that Hashem had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Yisrael's sake, told him all the travail that had come upon them along the way that Hashem saved them from" (Shmot 18:8)*, it was not just Yitro who heard about *Yetziat Mitzrayim* directly for the first time but also Tzipporah and her children.

The primary difference between the two is the question of Moshe's motivation. According to Shmot Rabbah, Moshe's decisions to send Tzipporah home must have been driven by something other than concern over the danger of bringing her to Egypt: the damage had already been done. Rather, Moshe believed that their mission had failed. He had never wanted any part in G-d's master plan, and had fled Egypt decades earlier to escape the cruelty and injustice rampant in the empire of his childhood. Moshe was likely more eager than ever to return to the comfortable anonymity afforded to him by Midian.**^[330]{.underline}^**

In contrast, the reason Moshe sent Tzipporah back to Midian according to Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael was so that they would not be a source of worry or concern, as their presence risked the danger of additional lives that could be lost, additional blood that could be tragically shed. Moshe ordered Tzipporah home so that she - and their children - would not have to experience any of the hardships or dangers that being inEgypt would inevitably entail.**^[331]{.underline}^**

Alternatively, unlike Moshe and Aharon - who each had an intimate knowledge of Bnai Yisrael's suffering in Egypt - Tzipporah had never been exposed to the Jews' slavery before. While the Torah does not tell us how much of the background behind Moshe's mission he revealed to his wife, one thing is clear: even if Moshe had in fact "caught Tzipporah up" on the suffering Bnai Yisrael were being subjected to and his mandate to free them, that is not anywhere near the same thing as her going there and seeing it for herself. This is due to a basic truth of human nature: there is an enormous difference between hearing about something terrible and processing it intellectually, and actually experiencing it empirically with one's own senses.**^[332]{.underline}^** In addition to removing Tzipporah from the very real physical danger of being present in Egypt, Moshe was also sparing her from the emotional trauma of seeing the blood in Egypt. In other words, both Tzipporah's body and mind were both spared from the shackles of Egyptian oppression.

It is armed with this insight gleaned from the words of Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael that we can begin to analyze the larger implications of Tzipporah's name. Recall that when Yitro comes to visit Moshe in the desert he is accompanied by Tzipporah after she had been sent away with her two children:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיִּשְׁמַ֞ע יִתְר֨וֹ כֹהֵ֤ן מִדְיָן֙ חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֵת֩ כׇּל אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ לְמֹשֶׁ֔ה וּלְיִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַמּ֑וֹ כִּֽי הוֹצִ֧יא יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃ וַיִּקַּ֗ח יִתְרוֹ֙ חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֶת צִפֹּרָ֖ה אֵ֣שֶׁת מֹשֶׁ֑ה אַחַ֖ר שִׁלּוּחֶֽיהָ׃ וְאֵ֖ת שְׁנֵ֣י בָנֶ֑יהָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר שֵׁ֤ם הָֽאֶחָד֙ גֵּֽרְשֹׁ֔ם כִּ֣י אָמַ֔ר גֵּ֣ר הָיִ֔יתִי בְּאֶ֖רֶץ נׇכְרִיָּֽה׃ וְשֵׁ֥ם הָאֶחָ֖ד אֱלִיעֶ֑זֶר כִּֽי אֱלֹהֵ֤י אָבִי֙ בְּעֶזְרִ֔י וַיַּצִּלֵ֖נִי מֵחֶ֥רֶב פַּרְעֹֽה׃**^[259]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Yitro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moshe, heard about what G-d did for Moshe and His nation Yisrael, that Hashem took Yisrael out of Mitzrayim. Yitro, the father-in-law of Moshe, took Tzipporah, Moshe's wife, after she had been sent away. And her two sons: One was named Gershom, for Moshe said 'I was a stranger in a foreign land', and the other was named Eliezer, for 'the G-d of my father assisted me and saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.'"**^[259]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Note the key concepts being employed here:

- A bird, in this case a mother (ציפור)

- The bird's two children (שני בני)

- An act of taking the bird (קיחה)

- An act of sending the bird away (שילוח)

These remind us of another instance in the Torah which contains many of the same words, albeit applied in an entirely different - and halachic, rather than narrative - context:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Hashem spoke to Moshe, saying: This shall be the law of the metzora on the day of his purification; he shall be brought before the Kohen. The Kohen shall go outside of the camp, and the Kohen shall see that the tzaru'a has been healed of the affliction of tzara'at. The Kohen shall command, and they shall take for the one being purified two pure, live birds, cedar wood, crimson stuff and hyssop. The Kohen shall command, and he will slaughter one of the birds in an earthenware utensil over running water. He shall then take the remaining live bird, the cedar wood, the crimson stuff and the hyssop, and he shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, over the running water. He shall sprinkle it seven times on the one being purified from tzara'at, and purify him; then he shall set the live bird free over the open field. The one being purified shall then wash his clothes, shave all his hair, bathe in water, and be purified; then he shall come back into the camp, and sit outside his tent for seven days."**^[333]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

The first phase in the purification process of a *metzora* involves the taking of two live birds. The Kohen leaves the camp and goes out to visit the *metzora* who has been quarantined outside. Once the Kohen confirms that the affliction has disappeared, a ritual involving two birds is undertaken, after which the *metzora*, no longer condemned beyond the camp's borders, is allowed to return.

Based on the midrashim quoted above, we realize that the *metzora* purification process is in fact an elaborate metaphor for the story of Tzipporah and her children. We will develop two ways to understand this metaphor. The first adds an incredible layer of richness to the teaching of Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael, while the second should answer our initial question of why Tzipporah is referred to by Tanchuma HaKadum Shmot as having *"purified her entire father's house like the blood of a bird"*.

**[Taking Flight]{.underline}**

The linguistic associations between the halachot of the *metzora* on the one hand and the return of Tzipporah and her two children on the other hand are too glaring to ignore. For example, just as regarding *metzora* the Kohen commands that two birds be taken, so too Yitro takes two "birds":

וַיִּקַּ֗ח יִתְרוֹ֙ ... צִפֹּרָ֖ה ... שְׁנֵ֣י בָנֶ֑יהָ: (שמות יח:ב-ג)

וְצִוָּה֙ הַכֹּהֵ֔ן וְלָקַ֧ח ... שְׁתֵּֽי צִפֳּרִ֥ים: (ויקרא יד:ד)

One of the birds is slaughtered over an earthenware utensil, and its blood is later sprinkled on the *metzora* to purify him:

וְשָׁחַ֖ט אֶת הַצִּפּ֣וֹר הָאֶחָ֑ת אֶל כְּלִי חֶ֖רֶשׂ עַל מַ֥יִם חַיִּֽים ... בְּדַם֙ ... הַצִּפֹּ֣ר הַשְּׁחֻטָ֔ה ... וְהִזָּ֗ה ... וְטִ֣הֲר֔: (ויקרא יד:ה-ז)

The second bird is dipped in the blood of the first, and afterwards released over the open field:

וְשִׁלַּ֛ח אֶת הַצִּפֹּ֥ר הַֽחַיָּ֖ה עַל פְּנֵ֥י הַשָּׂדֶֽה: (ויקרא יד:ז)

The earthenware utensil is used as a metaphor for the iron smelting pot of Egypt.**^[334]{.underline}^** Just as this vessel fills with the blood of the slaughtered bird, so too Egypt was filled with the blood of the Jewish slaves. The slaughtered bird, therefore, represents the death and suffering associated with slavery in Egypt.

According to this reading, the *metzora* ritual becomes transformed into a description of the historical aggadah developed in Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael. Moshe and his family face a critical decision after their son's shotgun circumcision, and the two birds represent the two options that the "birds" of Moshe's family - Tzipporah and her children - have before them. Moshe had not considered traveling down to Egypt alone and leaving his family behind, as his bringing Tzipporah with him to begin with makes evident. The situation demands that a Kohen command two birds be taken: Aharon HaKohen presents Moshe with two choices. One choice is to stay the course, but this would lead to the shedding of bird blood into the earthenware vessel, a metaphor for Tzipporah and her children being harmed, traumatized or killed in Egypt. The other choice is for Moshe to allow his birds to turn back to *"the open field"*, freeing them from danger and letting them continue their lives unencumbered by his mission.

Halachah dictates that these two live birds should be identical, symbolizing the equal potential inherent in both before the ritual begins and their destinies are irreversibly set in opposite directions.**^[335]{.underline}^** It is in this vein that Aharon HaKohen tells Moshe: you still have the chance to determine if Tzipporah is destined to be the first bird, who will not come out from Egypt unscathed, or the second bird, free to blissfully fly away and not look back. Right now either of those outcomes are possibilities, and which eventuality is actualized is up to you. But surely, concludes Aharon, we have enough bird blood on our hands already - why are you insisting on adding even more?

This midrash about Moshe and Tzipporah and the *metzora* ceremony, unrelated on the surface but linguistically and thematically intertwined on a deeper level, is one way to approach the significance of the two live**^[336]{.underline}^** birds mandated by the Torah. The *mashal-nimshal* mapping can be summarized as follows:

- Aharon represents the Kohen who commands that two birds be taken while Moshe represents the one who actually performs the act of taking.**^[337]{.underline}^**

- The first bird's blood spilled over an earthenware represents the danger of Tzipporah continuing down to Egypt, which is compared to an iron smelting pot.

- The second bird being set from over the field represents having Tzipporah turn around and go back to Midian, free from the dangers of Egypt.

- The two birds being identical represents the choice Moshe has to make by taking them.

**[Contagious Redemption]{.underline}**

While the above interpretation certainly makes sense, it does not seem to be what Tanchuma HaKadum 11 had in mind when it referenced Tzipporah purifying her father's house. Surely the bird's blood as a purifying agent is meant to draw a parallel to the *metzora*, but what idea could this succinct midrash be trying to impart?

We can also understand the birds, not as two mutually exclusive possibilities, but rather as the unfolding of a story of purification told in order. Instead of the birds both representing Tzipporah (and her children) as we just described, perhaps the two birds both represent the same person, whose blood is first drawn in order to enable his redemption.

The pesukim explain how the sprinkling of the first bird's blood is a purifying process that allows the *metzora* back into the camp. Whereas before the sprinkling the *metzora* was a condemned outcast, his symbolic bloodletting via the bird's death acts as a return ticket into the camp of G-d. Similarly, Tzipporah spilled the blood of a "bird" when she circumcised her son during the journey down to Egypt: *"Tzipporah took a rock and cut off the foreskin of her son, touched his feet, and said: You are a bridegroom of blood to me" (Shmot 4:25)*. This act caused the Hashem - understood by various aggadot to mean the Angel of Death, Destruction, Anger/Wrath, or Satan - to leave her family alone, not unlike to how spreading a lamb's blood on the lintel and doorposts acted as a sign to the Angel in Egypt to pass over the house and leaves its inhabitants unharmed. In the previous section we explained how according to Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael this episode is referring to the *brit milah* of Gershom, who had never been circumcised due to Moshe's vow. Seen in this light, Tzipporah's actions for her "baby bird" had a redemptive quality because they rescued Gershom from the wickedness and evil of *Avodah Zarah* and allowed him entry under the wings of the Shechinah: freedom to fly over the open field as a free bird.

This interpretation fits nicely with a detail of the *metzora* ritual not yet discussed: *"And he shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird" (Vayikra 14:6)*. Why did the bird who was permitted a return to the skies have to be dipped in the blood of its dead counterpart? Redemption can only be achieved through blood, freedom only realized through the sweat and tears of hardship and exile. The second bird is only set free after encountering the sacrificial blood required to allow its salvation to mature and come to fruition. So too, Gershom could only be purified and brought into the fold of his father's people after his mother released him from the bondage of his domineering, idolatrous grandfather.

Bnai Yisrael experience a national redemption through the blood of *korban pesach* while Gershom merits a personal redemption through the blood of *brit milah*. These two mitzvot are closely related to one another, as both signify a rebirth and cleansing through the forming of a covenant sealed in blood. The blood of *pesach* and the blood of *milah* are, in the eyes of the halachah and the midrash, inextricably intertwined,**^[338]{.underline}^** and both symbolize a redemptive process that leads to renewal.**^[339]{.underline}^**

How did Yitro feel about his daughter circumcising Gershom in flagrant violation of his agreement with Moshe? Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael is silent on this point, but the answer can be found in the pesukim themselves. Once Yitro heard about the redemption of *Yetziat Mitzrayim* he too was purified of his idolatry, confessing a belief in Hashem as *"greater than any other god" (Shmot 18:11)* and offering sacrifices of his own (Shmot 18:12). Surely even in the eyes of Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael, Yitro must not have been angry at Tzipporah's actions, for he himself recognizes Hashem soon after Gershom's *brit milah* occurs.**^[340]{.underline}^** While the Torah attributes Yitro's declaration as a result of hearing about the miracles done in Egypt, perhaps the fact that his grandson had already been converted by his daughter had already opened his mind to the idea. A person's views can certainly be influenced and changed by the decisions and choices made by his or her descendants, so Tzipporah's decision to circumcise Gershom may have also planted the seed in Yitro's mind that eventually sprouted into an acceptance of Hashem and His people.

This is what Tanchuma HaKadum 11 meant when it taught that Tzipporah's essence was *"purifying her entire father's house like the blood of a bird."* By cutting her baby bird's foreskin and shedding his blood, she was purifying him from a life of vanity and emptiness to one full of meaning and purpose, from a life of exclusion outside the camp to one of inclusion under the Divine presence, just like the blood of a bird slaughtered and sprinkled to heal a *metzora*. Her redemptive actions had a domino effect, eventually purifying Yitro as well who, by bringing Tzipporah and his two circumcised children with him to the desert, is acknowledging their contribution to his conversion as an honorary member of Bnai Yisrael.

**[Everlasting Life]{.underline}**

There is another section of the Torah which contains all of the keywords found in the description of Tzipporah's banishment and by extension the *parsha* of *metzora* purification, the mitzvah of *shiluach haken*:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
כִּ֣י יִקָּרֵ֣א קַן צִפּ֣וֹר לְפָנֶ֡יךָ בַּדֶּ֜רֶךְ בְּכׇל עֵ֣ץ א֣וֹ עַל הָאָ֗רֶץ אֶפְרֹחִים֙ א֣וֹ בֵיצִ֔ים וְהָאֵ֤ם רֹבֶ֙צֶת֙ עַל הָֽאֶפְרֹחִ֔ים א֖וֹ עַל הַבֵּיצִ֑ים לֹא תִקַּ֥ח הָאֵ֖ם עַל הַבָּנִֽים׃ שַׁלֵּ֤חַ תְּשַׁלַּח֙ אֶת הָאֵ֔ם וְאֶת הַבָּנִ֖ים תִּֽקַּֽח]לָ֑ךְ לְמַ֙עַן֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ וְהַאֲרַכְתָּ֖ יָמִֽים׃**^[341]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"If along the way you happen upon a bird's nest, in any tree or on the ground, with young chicks or eggs in it, and the mother is sitting over the young chicks or on the eggs, do not take the mother together with her young. You shall surely send the mother away and take only the young, so that it will be good for you and you will have a long life."**^[341]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

- Mother bird (ציפור, האם) = Moshe's wife (ציפורה אשת משה)

- Children or eggs (על הבנים) = Moshe's children (ואת שני בניה)

- Send the mother away (שלח תשלח את האם) = Tzipporah was sent away (אחר שילוחיה)

- Taking the children or eggs (ואת הבנים תקח לך) = Yitro took Tzipporah and the children (ויקח יתרו ... שני בניה)

The parallel between Tzipporah's name and the word used to describe the mother bird along with other glaring similarities implies importance of this commandment to the mysterious story of Tzipporah and her children. As in both the story of Tzipporah and the laws regarding a *metzora* in need of purification, we find here mention of multiple birds, an act of taking, and an act of sending away. While the *peshat* of this mitzvah is obviously halachic in nature,**^[342]{.underline}^** this mitzvah can be interpreted using a similar methodology to the one applied by the *metzora* ceremony as a parable for the life story of Tzipporah and her children.

To understand why, one needs to ask: what is the purpose, the motivation, the rationale behind *shiluach haken*? The most straightforward answer is also the one most commonly found in the midrashic literature:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וְשׁוֹר אוֹ שֶׂה אֹתוֹ וְאֶת בְּנוֹ לֹא תִשְׁחֲטוּ בְּיוֹם אֶחָד (ויקרא כב, כח), אָמַר רַבִּי בֶּרֶכְיָה בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי לֵוִי כְּתִיב (משלי יב, י): יוֹדֵעַ צַדִּיק נֶפֶשׁ בְּהֶמְתּוֹ, זֶה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא שֶׁכָּתוּב בְּתוֹרָתוֹ (דברים כב, ו): לֹא תִקַּח הָאֵם עַל הַבָּנִים:**^[343]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'An ox or a sheep, you shall not slaughter it and its son on the same day' (Vayikra 22:28). Rabbi Berechya said in the name of Rabbi Levi, it says: 'A tzaddik knows the soul of his animal' (Mishlei 12:10), this is HaKadosh Baruch Hu, as it says in His Torah: 'Do not take the mother with her children' (Devarim 22:6)."**^[343]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

*Shiluach haken* is meant to teach and instill mercy and compassion in us. Indeed, the midrash points us to another mitzvah, namely the prohibition to slaughter a mother and her kid on the same day, which is instructing a similar ethical lesson; other mitzvot, such as the humane nature of ritual slaughter, can be interpreted similarly.

A completely different rationale for this mitzvah is quoted in the commentary of Rabbeinu Bahaye,**^[344]{.underline}^** one that is Kabbalistic instead of intellectual, Zoharic instead of Maimonidean. This mitzvah is meant to embody, not mercy, but cruelty; through the cruelty displayed by the person performing the mitzvah, Divine mercy is aroused and increased in the world. In other words, separating a mother bird from her children who will befall harm is seen on the one hand as merciful, sparing the mother further pain, but on the other hand is brutish, as it causes the mother initial pain, and through that pain inflicted on the mother bird, the world as a whole will benefit from a cosmic realignment of the balance between compassion and justice.

This debate between the rational and mystical, between mercy and cruelty, mirrors the divergent midrashic opinions on why Moshe sent Tzipporah away in Mechilta DeRabbi Yishmael in **Note 81**. Rabbi Elazar HaModa'i argues that Moshe sent Tzipporah away with words after Aharon reprimanded him for endangering her; this act of sending the mother bird away was an act of kindness and concern on Moshe's part, to spare her from witnessing and being subject to, terrible suffering in Egypt. In contrast, Rabbi Yehoshua claims that Moshe sent Tzipporah away with a divorce document; although he does not state why, divorce is not usually done from a place of love and compassion for the other party. It could be argued that the outcome of sending Tzipporah away with a bill of divorce is similar in concept to the Zohar's reading that sending the mother bird away is actually meant to be intentionally unkind to her.

*Shiluach haken* can be found towards the end of Sefer Devarim, which records Moshe's final address and parting words to Bnai Yisrael. At this point Moshe is acutely aware that he will not merit to lead the nation into Eretz Yisrael; his own death is imminent, and his successor Yehoshua has been selected. As Moshe delivers his speech, he reflects on what he has accomplished in his life, and in parallel confronts his own impending mortality. Gershom and Eliezer not being viable candidates for leadership weighs on him; he knows that with his death there will be no continuation of his crown, no children to take over for him in the Promised Land. Indeed, Moshe's parting words in Sefer Devarim are delivered six months after Aharon's death, where Moshe saw firsthand his brother's sons inherit from their father.

Perhaps Moshe, looking back on his life and the role his children played in it, is riddled with guilt and regret. His sons were not a part of his destiny or his mission to free the Jewish people. They had been sent home before *Yetziat Mitzrayim*, were absent as G-d exalted Himself in all of His glory over Egypt. When Tzipporah was sent away, she took her children with her back to Midian. Gershom and Eliezers' mother was the deciding factor in their development, and even with Yitro's amenability to the Jewish cause and Tzipporah's heroic circumcision, their homeland and identity became Midian, through and through. Unlike Elazar and Itamar, they did not grow up surrounded by miracles and G-dliness; instead, they were raised in a land filled with idolatry, without a father figure to give them guidance and direction. In effect, Moshe realizes, his sending away Tzipporah and their children, even if done with noble intentions, meant that they would always be attached to their mother. Tzipporah's historical background and culture became the sole environmental presence in their lives.

Moshe understands that the sacrifice he made regarding his own family, while for the larger good of Bnai Yisrael, came at a price. He does not wish this same fate on others, and believes that he can warn others based on his experience. He therefore conceals within the mitzvah of *shiluach haken* a warning for others; a bitter, resigned exhortation that others should not follow his example. Interpolating the words of Yitro taking Tzipporah and the boys onto the mitzvah of *shiluach haken*, it can be read instead as a personal cry from Moshe to Bnai Yisrael. "If you send away the mother bird, make sure to take the children with you"; if you send away your Tzipporah, your wife and the mother of your children, make sure to take your children, keep them an integral part of your life, don't let them slip away. Do not sacrifice at the altar your lineage, the best guarantee for a legacy that will carry on your teachings and values, for the sake of a personal calling. I had no choice, Moshe desperately announces, because G-d had other plans for me; but, avoid what I have suffered, and what I now have to confront in my final days, at all costs. If you have to send away the mother bird, make sure to take the children with you; don't let others take them instead.

If you do this, Moshe concludes, "*it will be good for you and you will have a long life."* Many a commentator wondered why this seemingly trivial mitzvah contains a reward for long days, something rarely found explicitly in the Torah.**^[345]{.underline}^** What does Moshe mean here when he says that whoever observes the mitzvah will "have it good" and merit a "lengthening of days"?

If *shiluach haken* is understood as a poignant metaphor for taking your children under your wing and passing on your values to them, *length of days* takes on an entirely new meaning: it does not mean the number of years a person lives in this world before his physical body begins to decay, but rather his presence and legacy in the world. There is no greater good for a man than children who carry on his name**^[346]{.underline}^** and ensure that his legacy does not get erased and end with his death.**^[347]{.underline}^** A long life is not a *reward* for fulfilling a mitzvah to send the mother bird away before taking her chicks; it is a *consequence* of taking those chicks and ensuring they stay with you if the mother bird leaves. A person with sons that take on his crown will outlive his life, and continue to live on through his children. This is true *arichut yamim*.**^[348]{.underline}^**

Aharon achieved longevity through his sons Elazar and Itamar continuing the *Kehunah* and passing it onto the next generation. Moshe, seeing this, is moved to soberly offer up his own loss of *arichut yamim* as proof that a person should not do as he was compelled to if it is not absolutely necessary. The trappings and allure of achievements and honor in this world are not worth it if it means giving up on having your children be the embodiment of who you are and what you stand for.



**Part 3: Miriam**

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Any assessment of the relationship between Tzipporah, the concept of spiritual purity which her name and essence connote, and the affliction of *tzara'at*, cannot be complete without investigating the most lengthy - and midrashically informative - story that involves Tzipporah:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

<div style="flex: 1;">
"Miriam and Aharon spoke against Moshe regarding the Cushite woman he had taken, for he had taken a Cushite woman. They said: Does Hashem only speak through Moshe - does He not also speak through us? Hashem heard. Now the man Moshe was very humble, more so than any other man on the face of the earth. Hashem said suddenly to Moshe, Aharon and Miriam: Go out to the ohel moed, all three of you. All three of them went out. Hashem descended in a pillar of cloud and stood opposite the tent, and called: Aharon and Miriam. The two of them went out. Hashem said: listen to my words. If you have a prophecy from Hashem, I reveal myself to him in a vision, and speak to him in a dream. It is not so with my servant Moshe, in all My house he is trusted. I speak to him mouth-to-mouth, not with a vision of riddles. He views the image of Hashem - why did you not fear to speak against My servant Moshe? Hashem got angry at them and left. The cloud left from the tent, and behold Miriam had tzara't like snow; Aharon turned to Miriam and behold she had tzara'at. Aharon said to Moshe: Please my master, do not lay sin upon us, for we have acted foolishly and sinned. Do not let her be like a dead person who, upon leaving his mother's womb, has his flesh half-eaten. Moshe cried out to Hashem, saying: G-d, please heal her. Hashem said to Moshe: If her father had spit in her face, would she not quarantine for seven days? She shall be closed off outside the camp for seven days and then she shall come back. Miriam was quarantined outside of the camp for seven days, and the nation did not travel until Miriam was gathered in. Then the nation traveled from Chazerot and moved to Midbar Paran."**^[349]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Miriam is afflicted with *tzara'at* as punishment for speaking ill about Moshe's wife,**^[350]{.underline}^** arguing that she and Aharon are prophets just like him. There is much ambiguity to this story and as expected a myriad of interpretations exist, for similar to most examples where aggadic ingenuity is found, the pesukim seem to conceal more than they reveal. Tzipporah has not been mentioned by the Torah since her father Yitro brought her back after being sent away (Shmot 18:2), and Miriam has not been mentioned since she led all the women in echoing praise to Hashem after *kriat yam suf* (Shmot 15:20-21). What, exactly, is the relationship between these sisters-in-law? Were they close, indifferent or hostile towards one another? A careful grammatical reading would suggest that Miriam spoke against Moshe regarding his relationship with Tzipporah, and not against Tzipporah herself, which would indicate that Miriam did not harbor negative feelings against Tzipporah per se. But then what was Miriam upset about, and why did Hashem punish her so severely?

What is primarily motivating the midrashic approach to these questions is not only the contextual difficulties of this story in isolation, but the relevance of this episode to the rest of Torah. There is only one other explicit reference made to this incident, and even then the context is strictly regarding the halachot of *tzara'at*:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
הִשָּׁ֧מֶר בְּנֶֽגַע הַצָּרַ֛עַת לִשְׁמֹ֥ר מְאֹ֖ד וְלַעֲשׂ֑וֹת כְּכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁר יוֹר֨וּ אֶתְכֶ֜ם הַכֹּהֲנִ֧ים הַלְוִיִּ֛ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּיתִ֖ם תִּשְׁמְר֥וּ לַעֲשֽׂוֹת׃ זָכ֕וֹר אֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לְמִרְיָ֑ם בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶ֥ם מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃**^[351]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"In cases of an affliction of tzara'at be careful to do exactly as the Kohanaim instruct you. Take care to do as I have commanded them. Remember what Hashem your G-d did to Miriam on the way after you left Egypt."**^[351]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Why is this story recorded in the Torah, seemingly materializing out of nowhere and without any obvious lasting repercussions? This is the only time all three of Amram's children are mentioned together, and therefore it should be relevant to any broader fundamental understanding of them as siblings on the one hand, and to a deeper understanding of each child's own self-contained family unit on the other. The key to unlocking this story will actually be in placing the stories found after this one in the text both geographically and chronologically, as a careful reading of the midrashim will demonstrate.

**[Rashi's Approach]{.underline}**

Bnai Yisrael spent nearly a year at Har Sinai, arriving in the beginning of the 3rd month and departing on the 20th of the 2nd month the following year.**^[352]{.underline}^** We are told that the cloud rested in the desert of Paran:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַיְהִי בַּשָּׁנָה הַשֵּׁנִית, בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַשֵּׁנִי בְּעֶשְׂרִים בַּחֹדֶשׁ; נַעֲלָה, הֶעָנָן, מֵעַל, מִשְׁכַּן הָעֵדֻת: וַיִּסְעוּ בְנֵי-יִשְׂרָאֵל לְמַסְעֵיהֶם, מִמִּדְבַּר סִינָי; וַיִּשְׁכֹּן הֶעָנָן, בְּמִדְבַּר פָּארָן: (במדבר י:יא-יב)
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"In the second year, in the second month on the twentieth of the month, the cloud rose from atop the Mishkan of the testimony. Bnai Yisrael journeyed on their journeys, from Midbar Sinai, and the cloud rested in Midbar Paran." (Bemidbar 10:11-12)
</div>
</div>

This account seems to contradict what is recorded later on in Sefer Bemidbar:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

"He named that place Kivrot HaTa'avah, since that was where the nation that desired was buried. From Kivrot HaTa'avah the nation journeyed to Chatzerot, and they were in Chatzerot." (Bemidbar 11:34-35)
</div>

"Moshe sent the spies from Midbar Paran by the word of Hashem, all of them men, the heads of Bnai Yisrael." (Bemidbar 13:3)

"They went straight to Moshe and Aharon and the whole community of Bnai Yisrael at Kadesh in Midbar Paran, and they made their report to them and to the whole community, and showed them the fruit of the land." (Bemidbar 13:26)
</div>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

"They journeyed from Midbar Sinai, and encamped in Kivrot HaTa'avah. They journeyed from Kivrot HaTa'avah, and encamped in Chatzerot. They journeyed in Chatzerot, and encamped in Ritmah ..." (Bemidbar 33:16-18)
</div>
</div>

In other words:

- Option 1 = Midbar Sinai → Midbar Paran / Kivrot HaTa'avah → Chatzerot → Midbar Paran / Kadesh (Bemidbar 10-13)
- Option 2 = Midbar Sinai → Kivrot HaTa'avah → Chatzerot → Ritmah → etc (Bemidbar 33)

This problem is easily resolved by accepting that Midbar Paran was not the name of a specific place but rather a region that encompassed and included several campsites within it. Kivrot HaTa'avah, Chatzerot and Ritmah were all located in Midbar Paran.**^[353]{.underline}^**

This confusion opens the door for some elasticity in interpreting not just the locations of several key events, but also the order in which they occurred. We are told the story of Miriam afflicted with *tzara'at* happened in Chatzerot. But what about the following story, of the sin of the spies? We are told it happened in Midbar Paran, but as we just said that is a general area as opposed to a specific place. What we can say is that the spies were not sent from Chatzerot, since the people traveled from Chatzerot to wherever the sin of the spies occurred. We also know when the sin of the spies happened, since the consequence of that sin was the punishment to wander in the desert for 40 years. It must therefore have happened in the second year, soon after Bnai Yisrael left Har Sinai. This explains why the sin of the spies is recorded right after the story of Miriam in Chatzerot, since that makes the most sense chronologically.**^[354]{.underline}^**

Identifying the time and place of Korach's rebellion - which follows the story of the spies - is more challenging. Not only is no geographic information provided at all, but unlike the spies it is not clear when the rebellion happened.**^[355]{.underline}^** Did Korach's rebellion happen after the sin of the spies, as a chronological reading would suggest?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'Everyone is holy ... and why should you lord over' (Bemidbar 16:3). Immediately Moshe shook from the machloket, because this was already the fourth transgression on their hands. What is this comparable to? The son of a king who transgressed against his father, and the king's friend appeased him once, twice and thrice. When the son transgressed a fourth time, the hands of the king's friend became weak, and he said: how many times can I bother the king? So too here with Moshe regarding Yisrael. They sinned by the calf, 'Moshe pleaded' (Shmot 32:11); by the murmurers, 'Moshe prayed' (Bemidbar 11:2); by the spies, 'Moshe said to Hashem Egypt will hear' (Bemidbar 14:13); by the rebellion of Korach, his hands became weak, and he said: how many times can I bother HaMakom? Therefore: 'Moshe heard and he fell on his face' (Bemidbar 16:4)."**^[356]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Moshe's hands were weak because Korach was already the fourth transgression, thus indicating that Korach's rebellion took place after the sin of the spies. This is perhaps the most straightforward understanding and one that is easiest to explain, both because it is the order in which the stories are presented in, and because it frames the impetus for Korach's rebellion as a consequence of the devastating pronouncement of 40 years in the desert. The discontent and anger felt by the people in the aftermath of the deferred redemption helped fuel Korach's cause.

Rashi in his comments on Chumash to Bemidbar 16:4 quotes this Tanchuma Yelamdenu Korach, indicating his agreement with this interpretation. Yet in his comments to the beginning of Sefer Devarim Rashi offers another opinion, one that on the surface seems difficult to understand:

'And Chatzerot'. The place of the rebellion of Korach. Another idea: HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Bnai Yisrael, you should have learned from what I did to Miriam in Chatzerot over lashon hara, yet you still spoke against HaMakom."**^[358]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Rashi believes that the list of locations Sefer Devarim opens with are allusions to places where Bnai Yisrael had sinned during their 40 years of wandering in the desert,**^[359]{.underline}^** and Chatzerot is one of the locations on that list. However, Rashi's first approach forces us to interpret the three stories of Miriam's *tzara'at* affliction, the sin of the spies, and Korach's rebellion anachronistically, for if the stories involving Miriam and Korach both happened at Chatzerot, Korach's rebellion must have preceded the sin of the spies, which only unfolded after Bnai Yisrael had traveled from Chatzerot to Kadesh. If this were not challenging enough to accept, Rashi himself constrains the amount of time Bnai Yisrael spent in Chatzerot to exactly seven days, and no longer: Miriam spoke against Moshe and was stricken with *tzara'at* on the first day in Chatzerot, and Bnai Yisrael left after seven days when her mandatory quarantine had ended.**^[360]{.underline}^** In other words, Korach's rebellion took place during that seven day period while the nation was waiting at Chatzerot for Miriam's quarantine to end.

Fascinatingly, this first approach found in Rashi does not appear in any known midrashic sources that were known to predate him. It is not clear if Rashi was basing himself on an earlier midrashic tradition or innovating his own idea. Regardless, Rashi felt compelled to identify Chatzerot as the site of Korach's rebellion, despite it demanding an uprooting of the story from the natural chronological order given it by the text, and despite it being limited to a specific, narrow window of under a week. It is also curious that Rashi also offers a second approach, the more straightforward explanation of Chatzerot as the place of Miriam's *lashon hara*.**^[361]{.underline}^** Yet, he still felt it necessary to not only mention Korach's rebellion, but to mention it first before an idea more closely tied to the *peshat* as it requires less aggadic gymnastics and is supported by other midrashim.**^[362]{.underline}^**

Rashi appears to have felt that there was something fundamental and important that connects what happened to Miriam at Chatzerot with what transpired during the rebellion of Korach. This only becomes revealed with a deeper understanding of what really troubled Miriam and led her to speak out against her brother.**^[363]{.underline}^**

**[Delayed Journey]{.underline}**

Bnai Yisrael encamped and traveled during their wanderings through the desert based on a directive communicated by HaKadosh Baruch Hu via a cloud that accompanied them in the desert. When the cloud rested, Bnai Yisrael encamped, and when the cloud rose, they journeyed. It did not matter how long the cloud rested for; the people's movements were dictated by the rising and resting of this Divine cloud. The Torah even found it necessary to emphasize this point, repeating the phrase *"by the word of Hashem Bnai Yisrael journeyed, and by the word of Hashem they encamped"* three times in the span of several pesukim.**^[364]{.underline}^**

It is rather striking, then, that a mere two chapters later we are told of an explicit violation of this rule. After Hashem's anger is kindled at Miriam and Aharon at Chatzerot, this cloud rises up and reveals Miriam afflicted with *tzara'at* like snow. Hashem then commands that Miriam should be shut up outside of the camp for seven days, and only after Miriam was gathered back into the camp did Bnai Yisrael travel from Chatzerot (Bemidbar 12:9-10, 14-15). Does this not fly in the face of the confident, thrice repeated assertion from Bemidbar 10 that Bnai Yisrael kept the charge of Hashem and always journeyed when the cloud rose from the Mishkan? How then could Bnai Yisrael have waited seven days until Miriam's quarantine had ended?

Seforno notes this problem and suggests that Bnai Yisrael understood this was a unique circumstance, and inferred that in this situation HaKadosh Baruch Hu actually did not want the nation to travel. His cloud had risen, not as an indication to begin the next journey, but in order to distance Himself from the impurity of Miriam's *tzara'at*.**^[365]{.underline}^**

The midrash is troubled by a similar question but resolves it differently. Instead of the people's delay being a reflection of HaKadosh Baruch Hu's anger - as Seforno suggests - it is seemingly quite the opposite: a sign of His love and desire to reward good righteousness:**^[366]{.underline}^**

Miriam waited for Moshe for a short period, as it says: 'His sister waited for him from afar' (Shmot 2:4). Therefore, Yisrael waited for her for seven days in the desert, as it says: 'The nation did not journey until Miriam was brought in (Bemidbar 12:15).'"**^[367]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is a later version of this same midrashic tradition that embellishes Sotah's teaching:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
והעם לא נסע ללמדך שבמדה שאדם מודד בה מודדין לו, מרים המתינה למשה שעה אחת שנאמר ותתצב אחותו מרחוק (שמות ב:ד) לפיכך עכב לה הקב"ה ארון ושכינה כהנים ולוים וישראלים ושבעה ענני כבוד שנא' והעם לא נסע עד האסף מרים (במדבר יב:טו):**^[368]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"'The nation did not journey. This teaches you that the way a man measures, that is how others measure him. Miriam waited for Moshe for a short period, as it says: 'His sister waited for him from afar' (Shmot 2:4). Therefore, HaKadosh Baruch Hu held up the Aron and Shechinah, Kohanim Leviim and Yisraelim, and the seven clouds of glory on her behalf, as it says: 'The nation did not journey until Miriam was brought in (Bemidbar 12:15).'"**^[368]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

There is an important difference between the version found in Sotah and the one in Yalkut Shimoni, namely regarding the question of who sanctioned the week-long delay. According to Sotah, Bnai Yisrael on their own decided to wait for Miriam; while it was based on their understanding of Hashem's will, it was still a human-initiated decision. Perhaps the later iteration of this midrash found in Yalkut Shimoni is bothered by this, and is not satisfied with claiming that the nation somehow realized this time that Hashem wanted them to delay. After all, even for journeys of just one or two days the people would immediately depart when the cloud rose. It must be that the seven day delay was not merely sanctioned by Hashem after the fact; rather, it was actively caused by Him. The language found in Yalkut Shimoni is much stronger and more explicit, effectively removing the decision to delay from Bnai Yisrael and having HaKadosh Baruch Hu instead as the primary deciding force in the story.

Is there a *nafka mina* between these two approaches? Let us consider the following: if Bnai Yisrael had in fact journeyed onward in the desert when the cloud rose from atop the tent, presumably Miriam would have journeyed in lockstep with the rest of the camp for seven days while keeping the necessary distance. According to Sotah, the decision to postpone the departure was made by Bnai Yisrael, and while Hashem clearly acquiesced perhaps He would not have insisted on that delay beforehand. Had Bnai Yisrael instead actually started to journey once His cloud rose, perhaps He would have been amenable to that. In contrast, this outcome was never a viable option for Yalkut Shimoni: it was Hashem Himself who ordered the people to wait seven days, thereby breaking from the general "charge" of traveling when the cloud rises or rests. While this was an exception to the usual rules of the cloud's departure, it was not a violation of that charge because Hashem had commanded them to stay put, so there is no contradiction.

A profound *hashkafic* debate may also be underpinning the nuanced differences between these two midrashim. When we say that Hashem rewards those who act righteously, *middah keneged middah*, does this mean to say that He directly intervenes to ensure that justice is meted out, even at the cost of human free will? Or does it mean that the way events unfold in the world on a macro level somehow will end up squaring with this principle and working out the way they should? For Sotah, it was Bnai Yisrael who decided to wait for Miriam, thereby rewarding her for her attentiveness to baby Moshe eighty years earlier. The fulfillment of *middah keneged middah* in this instance happens through the Jewish people as a collective agent of the Divine will. For Yalkut Shimoni, it is Hakadosh Baruch Hu who directly insists on postponing any departure for seven days in order to ensure that Miriam is rewarded for her sisterly concern. Seen in this light *middah keneged middah* is upheld as a result of explicit Divine intervention.

There is a third ramification as well to whether it was Hashem or Bnai Yisrael who caused a break from the usual routine of leaving camp when His cloud rises: who is to blame - *keveyachol* - for any negative consequences of that delay. If Korach's rebellion transpired during that waiting period, as Rashi argues, then perhaps the circumstances which needed to align to allow the seeds of revolt to blossom would not have occurred, and disaster could have been averted. However, this last suggestion is troubling because both according to Sotah and Yalkut Shimoni the motivation for delaying leaving Chatzerot was for the right reason: to acknowledge Miriam's protectiveness over Moshe. But if the reason for waiting was in order to recognize the righteousness in that aspect of Miriam's personality, then how could that decision possibly set the stage for Korach's rebellion?

**[Prophetic Tragedy]{.underline}**

Miriam's *lashon hara* against Moshe stemmed from her indignation that he had separated from his spouse, something she and Aharon had not been required to do:

"Why does the Torah say Miriam and then Aharon? Because she spoke against Moshe first, and that is why the text mentioned her before Aharon. What did they say? 'Did Hashem only speak through Moshe' (Bemidbar 12:2), meaning, did Hashem only speak through Moshe, who separated from his wife? 'Did He not also speak through us' - He also spoke with us and we did not separate from the natural way relations with our spouses. How did Miriam know that Moshe had separated from women? Rabbi Natan says: Miriam was next to Tzipporah when Moshe was told 'Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp' (Bemidbar 11:27). When Tzipporah heard this, she said: woe to them and their wives. And from when had Moshe separated from the natural way? From the time that HaKadosh Baruch Hu had said to Moshe at Sinai before Matan Torah, that he should sanctify the nation and he said to them: 'For three days do not come near your wife' (Shmot 19:15). The people separated from their wives and Moshe separated from his wife. After Matan Torah, however, HaKadosh Baruch Hu said to Moshe: 'Go say to them, return to your tents; but you, come stand with Me' (Devarim 5:30-31), and do not go back to the natural way. And when Tzipporah said: Woe to their wives, she meant because they are not susceptible to prophecy so they will separate from their wives just as my husband Moshe separated from me. That is how Miriam knew, and she told Aharon. And if Miriam, who did not have any ill intent towards Moshe, was punished, someone who speaks ill of his fellow and says lashon hara* - *how much more so should such a person be stricken with tzara'at ... 'Hashem said suddenly (Bemidbar 12:4), that He appeared to Miriam and Aharon suddenly, and they were impure because of the natural way i.e. were having relations with their spouses, and they called out 'water water'. He did this to let them know that Moshe had done well to separate from his wife, since the Shechinah reveals Herself to him constantly and there is no set time for receiving it. And He also said to them: 'I speak with Moshe mouth to mouth' (Bemidbar 12:8) - I said to him mouth to mouth to separate from his wife."**^[369]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Tzipporah had returned to reunite with the father of her children, only to have her husband Moshe separate from her because of his need to be in a constant state of preparedness to receive prophecy from HaKadosh Baruch Hu.**^[370]{.underline}^** Miriam did not realize that Moshe's level of prophecy was unique and as such demanded a higher level of sacrifice than what He need from either her or Aharon. While the Rabbis acknowledge Miriam's *lashon hara* was not proper, as is incontrovertibly evidenced by her punishment, they argue that her intention was actually good, thus teaching an important message about how careful we need to be with our words.**^[371]{.underline}^** Yet while we can understand why she would feel indignant on Tzipporah's behalf upon discovering Moshe's decision, is that really enough of a reason to explain her maligning his actions?

Miriam's assertion that she is a prophetess is indeed confirmed by the Torah, which labels her a *nevi'ah* in the aftermath *kriat yam suf*:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וַתִּקַּח֩ מִרְיָ֨ם הַנְּבִיאָ֜ה אֲח֧וֹת אַהֲרֹ֛ן אֶת הַתֹּ֖ף בְּיָדָ֑הּ וַתֵּצֶ֤אןָ כׇֽל הַנָּשִׁים֙ אַחֲרֶ֔יהָ בְּתֻפִּ֖ים וּבִמְחֹלֹֽת׃ וַתַּ֥עַן לָהֶ֖ם מִרְיָ֑ם שִׁ֤ירוּ לַֽיהֹוָה֙ כִּֽי גָאֹ֣ה גָּאָ֔ה ס֥וּס וְרֹכְב֖וֹ רָמָ֥ה בַיָּֽם׃**^[372]{.underline}^**
</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">
"Miriam the nevi'ah, the sister of Aharon, took the tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with drums and dance. Miriam answered them: Sing to Hashem, for He has triumphed gloriously; He has hurled horse and chariot into the sea."**^[372]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Three questions can be posed based on this description:

- Why is Miriam described as Aharon's sister but not Moshe's sister?

- If Miriam is already referred to as a *nevi'ah* at this point, does that imply she had received prophecy before the splitting of *Yam Suf*?

- What was the content of Miriam's prophecy?

The Talmud describes how Miriam had prophesied that her mother Yocheved would give birth to a son who would redeem all of Bnai Yisrael from Egyptian bondage.**^[373]{.underline}^** The reason she is referred to as Aharon's sister in that context is because the prophecy was made before Moshe was born, as it was made regarding his birth. Amram had separated from Yocheved as a result of the royal decree to murder any Jewish baby boys, but Miriam scolded him for acting this way as it condemned not just potential boys but also potential girls as well. Amram was convinced and remarried Yocheved, and due to that second marriage Moshe was born, thus ensuring the fulfillment of Miriam's prophecy and the deliverance of Bnai Yisrael.**^[374]{.underline}^**

Aside from the textual issue of Miriam being referred to as Aharon's sister, this also explains another textual difficulty regarding the lack of proper names in Shmot 2. Amram and Yocheved are referred to simply as members of the tribe of Levi, even though we are given their actual names later on in the text. To explain this, the Talmudic account finds in this a hint to their separation and remarriage. Yet beyond the textual resolutions what this story reveals is a consistent account of Miriam's personality and someone who is both deeply caring and empathetic towards children in general and her family in particular**^[375]{.underline}^**, but also someone who is brazen and has the strength of character to challenge others when she believes them to be mistaken or misguided, particularly when it comes to hesitations around bringing new life into the world.

This portrayal of Miriam provides a much needed backdrop for the story of her *lashon hara* against Moshe. Miriam - also known as Pu'ah - was in her youth both a midwife who brought babies to life, and a prophetess whose stubbornness and insistence brought Moshe to life through the marital reunion of their parents. More than anything else, Miriam has lived and breathed the importance of bringing life into the world, and not letting any excuse distract from that holiest of missions. And now it is Moshe himself who is separated from his wife - the same Moshe whose very birth was the result of a divorced couple that remarried due to Miriam's prophecy.**^[376]{.underline}^** In effect, then, Miriam is asking incredulously: how can my little brother Moshe separate from his wife because of prophecy - doesn't he know that it was only because of my prophecy that our parents got back together in the first place? If it had not been for me, they would not have remarried, and if it hadn't been for their remarriage, Moshe would never have been born. So how can Moshe claim that separation and abstinence are now necessary for his prophecy?

This explains why Miriam went to Aharon and discussed the matter with him. Aharon was known for his successful efforts in reconciling divorced couples who had already brought children into the world.**^[377]{.underline}^** As a fellow prophet, and as someone with a shared belief in the importance of staying married, Miriam felt comfortable taking Aharon into her confidence.**^[378]{.underline}^**

Though well intentioned, Miriam was ultimately mistaken. The rules for Moshe were just different, his prophecy was unparalleled and his status was unique, even when compared to his siblings or parents. G-d spoke with him mouth-to-mouth, clearly and not in riddles; Miriam's reasoning was too clouded from a life informed and shaped by bringing couples together and generating and sustaining life to see that Moshe was an exception to the rule.

With this background we can revisit the question raised earlier: what led to the success of Korach's rebellion? There are various midrashim which address this, and they all have in common a trigger event, a precursor or prior story that set up a situation which was ripe for exploitation by Korach. As discussed earlier, the decree of death in the wilderness due to the spies' sin would certainly explain how Korach was able to tap into the peoples' desperation and resentment. But perhaps there is another possibility. Korach's main point of protest, boiled down to its essentials, was a challenge to the authority of Moshe. In particular, he attacked Moshe by decrying that he was: *"Lording himself over the congregation of Hashem" (Bemidbar 16:3)*. Until Korach expressed this sentiment, Moshe was the unquestioned leader of Bnai Yisrael. Although Bnai Yisrael had complained and rebelled multiple times in the past, it had never been a revolt against Moshe's claim to leadership directly; it was always about a desire for food or water, or the need to worship a visible god. No one had dared to openly defy Moshe before the way Korach had, so why did Korach think he would be able to not only do so but also garner public support against Moshe's supreme status?

The answer, of course, is that Korach was not the first person to challenge Moshe's authority as being unique and supreme. Miriam and Aharon - Moshe's own siblings - questioned his superiority in Chatzerot. They argued that Moshe was no better than they were, that his place in the pecking order did not excuse him from behavior which was, in their view, unacceptable.

It was this tragic act of *lashon hara* - well intentioned - that started the snowball effect. Miriam is shut out of the camp for seven days, and something unusual happens: the Divine cloud rises suddenly, which would normally be an indication that the time to travel had arrived. Yet as Rashi argued, Miriam was afflicted with *tzara'at* the same day that Bnai Yisrael arrived in Chatzerot. The people see that Miriam is removed from the camp, and the cloud inexplicably rises the same day it rests, right upon arrival. Naturally everybody in Bnai Yisrael would want to know what happened. Why would the cloud rise right after settling? Could it have to do with Miriam's condition? Gossip and rumors began to infiltrate the people's tents, things spiraled out of control, and ultimately the reason for Miriam's punishment was arrived at: she had questioned a fundamental truth, previously unassailable, that Moshe was beyond rebuke. Suddenly - almost instantaneously - the *lashon hara* spoken by Moshe's own siblings normalized a topic of conversation which was previously unthinkable: assailing Moshe's authority.

A poignant midrash provides an apt metaphor when describing a similar deconstruction process when Amalek attacked Bnai Yisrael after *Yetziat Mitzrayim*:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">
וְרַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי, קָרְךָ, הֵקֶרְךָ לִפְנֵי אֲחֵרִים. אָמַר רַבִּי חוּנְיָא, מָשָׁל לְמָה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה. לְאַמְבָּטִי רוֹתַחַת, שֶׁלֹּא הָיְתָה בְּרִיָּה יְכוֹלָה לֵירֵד בְּתוֹכָהּ, בָּא בֶּן בְּלִיַּעַל אֶחָד וְקָפַץ לְתוֹכָהּ, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנִּכְוָה, הֵקֵרָהּ לִפְנֵי אֲחֵרִים. אַף כָּאן כֵּיוָן שֶׁיָּצְאוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִמִּצְרַיִם, הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא קָרַע הַיָּם לִפְנֵיהֶם וְנִשְׁתַּקְּעוּ הַמִּצְרִים לְתוֹכוֹ. נָפַל פַּחְדָּן עַל כָּל הָאֻמּוֹת, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: אָז נִבְהֲלוּ אַלּוּפֵי אֱדוֹם וְגוֹ' (שם טו, טו). כֵּיוָן שֶׁבָּא עֲמָלֵק וְנִזְדַּוֵּג לָהֶם, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנָּטַל אֶת שֶׁלּוֹ מִתַּחַת יָדָן, הֵקֵרָן לִפְנֵי אֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם:**^[379]{.underline}^**

<div style="flex: 1;">
"The Rabbis said: 'Met you' - this means they cooled you in the eyes of others. Rabbi Chunya said: A parable, what is this similar to? To a boiling hot bath, that no living thing could descend into. One wicked man came and jumped into it. Even though he got scalded, he cooled it in the eyes of others as something which was now thinkable to do. So too here - when Yisrael left Egypt, HaKadosh Baruch Hu split the sea before them and the Egyptians were drowned inside it. Fear of Bnai Yisrael fell upon the nations, as it says: 'The chiefs of Edom trembled' (Shmot 15:15). Once Amalek came and engaged them in battle, even though Amalek was handed his portion by them i.e. defeated, it cooled Bnai Yisrael as a potential target of attack in the eyes of the world."**^[379]{.underline}^**
</div>
</div>

Amalek attacking Bnai Yisrael after the miracles of Egypt is compared to a boiling bath which no one is willing to enter into. One wicked man jumped in and got burnt, but even though he was "punished" he made the bath seem cooler to everyone else. So too with Amalek: they attacked Bnai Yisrael who had an aura of invincibility and were seen as unbeatable. Even though Amalek was defeated by Yehoshua, by confronting Bnai Yisrael in battle they had transformed the idea and concept of attacking Bnai Yisrael into a very real possibility.

The same principle taught by the wicked man and Amalek can also be applied to the *lashon hara* of Miriam. Why was she punished so harshly? Not because of her specific *lashon hara* in and of itself, but because of what it led to: she had now set the precedent, forever irreversible, which made it acceptable to murmur against Moshe's leadership. And just like the wicked man was scalded and Amalek was weakened in battle, Miriam was punished with *tzara'at*, but the damage was done: Moshe's unassailability seems less unassailable for the first time. This opened a Pandora's box and provided the fuel Korach needed to instigate the flames of his revolt. This is why Rashi argues that Korach's rebellion happened in Chatzerot: that seven day period wasted waiting impatiently for Miriam was the perfect breeding ground for bitterness and destruction.

The national week-long wait may have been a reward for Miriam, but why did it happen? Hashem had demanded it as punishment: *"If her father had spit in her face, would she not hide in shame for seven days" (Bemidbar 12:14)*.**^[380]{.underline}^** The people could and should have used this opportunity to reflect on what happened to Miriam, and to learn the dangers and consequences of *lashon hara*. Instead the opposite happens: the people are idle, for while they are not traveling, neither are they at Har Sinai anymore; they have been stopped at Chatzerot, a random spot in the desert of Paran. The people are paralyzed by the *lashon hara* that is spreading like a virus throughout the camp,**^[381]{.underline}^** and the situation is ripe for abuse and manipulation.

Miriam's story is not just an isolated incident, meant only to impart a message about the dangers of *lashon hara*. It also describes the unraveling of Moshe's unquestioned authority, unwittingly instigated by his own elder sister. It presented an opportunity for Korach to appear on the scene and rile up Bnai Yisrael, to fan the flames of *lashon hara* that had burst forth from Miriam's mouth and spread throughout the camp. As we have seen, this connection is beautifully drawn by Rashi's connecting Korach's rebellion to Chatzerot along with Miriam's *lashon hara*. Indeed, the midrash teaches that Korach and his followers, who like Miriam promulgated *lashon hara* against Moshe Rabbeinu, were deserving of *tzara'at*:

"'Moshe heard' (Bemidbar 16:4). What did he hear? Rabbi Shmuel Bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This teaches that they suspected Moshe of adultery, as it says: 'They were jealous of Moshe in the camp' (Tehillim 106:16). Rabbi Shmuel Bar Yitzchak said in the name of Rav: This teaches that every person was jealous of his wife on account of Moshe. 'Moshe went to Datan and Aviram' (Bemidbar 16:25). Reish Lakish said: From here we learn that one should not continue a quarrel. Rav said: Whoever continues in a quarrel violates the prohibition of: 'Do not be like Korach and his assembly' (Bemidbar 17:5). Rav Asi said: Whoever continues in a quarrel deserves tzara'at - it says here: 'As Hashem said to him by the hand of Moshe' (Bemidbar 17:5), and it says there: 'Hashem said to him further, bring your hand' (Shmot 4:6)."**^[382]{.underline}^**

The connection between *tzara'at*, personified here by Miriam, and *machloket*, exemplified by Korach,**^[383]{.underline}^** speaks to the consequences of *lashon hara*: direct Divine punishment that demands atonement, but also the remedy is too late: it is like a fire that has spread beyond the owner's reach, and spirals into exponentially more divisiveness and anger.

This explains why Rashi argues that Chazerot is where Korach's rebellion happened. This can either be meant in the literal sense, that the rebellion of Korach happened during those seven days that Miriam was in quarantine, or it can be meant in the thematic, meta-literal sense that Korach's rebellion was rooted in Chazerot, namely in the *lashon hara* that began there but then spread to the minds and hearts of *keriyei mo'ed anshei shem* who were seduced into joining Korach in his crusade against Moshe and Aharon.

This interpretation is further supported by the astonishing claim that Moshe was so devastated by Korach's rebellion because he was suspected of stealing everyone's wives and committing adultery.**^[384]{.underline}^** Miriam's initial complaint against Moshe was that he separated from his wife, but as *lashon hara* spreads its tentacles the truth gets distorted and bent: accusations of cheating are an almost natural progression of Miriam's *lashon hara* about Moshe's marital relationship with his wife. The story sells itself, and makes sense aside from its patent falsehood: the leader of Bnai Yisrael had separated from his wife, claiming it was because of his need for prophecy, when in fact he was abusing his power and taking women from among the people. The appropriateness of the Earth opening its mouth and swallowing those who opened their own mouths and slandered Moshe speaks for itself.

The Talmud goes out of its way to insert wives into the story of Korach's rebellion as major influences in their husbands' behavior. In particular, On's wife was righteous and saved him from perishing, while Korach's power-hungry wife egged his destructive behavior on.**^[385]{.underline}^** While at first glance it is puzzling that the aggadah insert these men's wives so prominently and aggressively into the story of Korach's rebellion, if we understand the kernels of protest which Korach was sowing as being planted during Miriam's slander against Moshe in relation to *his* wife, then we can readily see why tensions - which brewed as a result of false rumors Korach and his followers had helped circulate about Moshe taking other wives - would involve those very same men's wives.**^[386]{.underline}^**

The danger of even speaking against someone you love, and with the right intentions, highlights just how dangerous *lashon hara* is, and how careful we have to be in exercising caution with the words we say. Our mouths are unique among the human organs, hidden behind two rows of defenses - teeth and lips - as a constant reminder of how carefully guarded they need to remain. To avoid the fate of a *metzora* placed in quarantine and watched by everyone else, we must be proactively vigilant and watch the words that we say. We must learn from the martyrdom of Miriam, and recognize that some grievances spoken in private can, in short order, lead to great and uncontrollable tragedy.
